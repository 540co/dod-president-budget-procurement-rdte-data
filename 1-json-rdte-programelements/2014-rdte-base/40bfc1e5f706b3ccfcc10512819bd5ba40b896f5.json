            "val": "In FY 2014, the \"Disruptive Demonstrations\" project was inserted to support development and demonstration of time-sensitive capabilities that address Secretary\/Department Strategic Vectors and Chairman\u2019s Gap Assessment of capability shortfalls.  As a result, we anticipate less partner funding for those strategic investment areas and will have to rely on greater partner funding for other Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) projects.  Overall, we envision fewer JCTD projects that will be longer in duration.\n\nToday's operations require faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore, the JCTD Program works to accelerate project selection, encourage capability demonstration of less than two years where possible, but supports longer term projects (three years or more) when technical challenges warrant it.  This revised process includes:  streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The JCTD Program directly addresses Joint, Coalition, and\/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program), the JCTD Program is often viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop, assess, and transition time-sensitive capability solutions into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors, the JCTD Program typically leverages two dollars in partner funding for every one dollar in the JCTD budget.  Thus, the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a traditional Research and Development (R&D) program.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities:  to date, over 80 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for transition discussion.\n- The program delivers capabilities rapidly; projects execute quicker than the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD\/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered \u2013 or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 without the JCTD program.  Recent examples are:  sensor capabilities for finding and interdicting tunnels delivered to Afghanistan to address a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) requirement and to interdict tunnels on the US-Mexico border; autonomous technologies for unmanned aerial resupply of forward operating bases; a sensor capability to provide situational awareness in the riverine environment; and a deployable, integrated system to provide essential services in the immediate aftermath of a crisis event, to include renewable-powered water desalination deployed to all the COCOMs.  \n-The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.\n- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DOS), and Department of Transportation (DOT).  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.\n- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has recently established priorities for Anti-Access\/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include all JCTDs will have deliverables within 15 months (analyses, designs, models, etc.) to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 18 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration to meet COCOM needs.  Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned are additional key metrics.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing Program of Record (POR), providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto General Service Administration (GSA) schedule for procurement by DOD users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 were successfully transitioned."

During the FY 2012 Continuing Resolution (CR) period (September to December 2011), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) funds from the JCTD program were used for critical operations of the HPCMP Army program.  The HPCMP was devolved from OSD to Army as part of the FY 2011 Secretary of Defense efficiencies initiative.  Under Continuing Resolution rules, Army could not fund the HPCMP new start initiative and did not have the prior year budget authority for HPCMP.  Thus, OSD JCTD program funds were used for HPCMP."

In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.\n- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.

The Director, JCTD Program, maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and\/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (POR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) stated goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing POR, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 successfully transitioned."
