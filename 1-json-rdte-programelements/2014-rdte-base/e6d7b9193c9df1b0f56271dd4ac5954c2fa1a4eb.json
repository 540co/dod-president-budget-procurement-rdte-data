            "val": "This program element (PE) fosters university and industry based research to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities.  Broadly, the work in this project falls into three categories: Collaborative Technology Alliances \/ Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs\/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army.  CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission.  CTAs have been competitively established in the areas of Micro Autonomous Systems Technology (MAST), Network Sciences, Robotics, Cognition and Neuroergonomics, and Multi-Scale Materials Modeling. COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs and couple state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology.  Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students.  This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long-term multidisciplinary effort.  The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing. The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation.  Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments.  This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU\/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this PE is performed by: the Army Research Lab (ARL) in Adelphi, MD; the US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) in Warren, MI; Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), in Huntsville, AL, and Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), in Aberdeen, MD."

This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research will focus on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and will be conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are considered are: 1)vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2)anticipating, detecting and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD."

Research in Detection will develop theories and models that relate properties and capabilities of cyber threat detection and recognition processes\/mechanisms to properties of a malicious activity, and of properties of Army networks.  Research in Agility will develop theories and models to support planning and controls of cyber maneuver (i.e., \"maneuver\" in the space of network characteristics and topologies) that would describe how control and end-state of the maneuver are influenced by fundamental properties of threats, such as might be rapidly inferred from limited observations of a new, recently observed threat.

                            "val": "This project fosters research through the Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a competitively selected industry and university consortium, to leverage world-class research in support of future force and Army transformation needs. Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now. Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored. The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future. This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems. These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability. The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance. This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

The objective is to perform sustained multidisciplinary basic research supporting technology to provide the Army with biomolecular sensor platforms with unprecedented sensitivity, reliability, and durability; higher-order arrays of functional electronic and optoelectronic components capable of self-assembly and with multi-functions; and new biological means to process, integrate, and network information. These sensor platforms will incorporate proteomics (large scale study of proteins) technology, DNA sequence identification and detection tools, and the capability for recognition of viral pathogens. A second ICB objective is to educate and train outstanding students and post doctoral researchers in revolutionary areas of science to support Army Transformation. The ICB has many industrial partners, such as IBM and SAIC, and has strong collaborations with Argonne, Lawrence Berkley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories, the Army's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, the Institute for Creative Technologies, and Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) laboratories.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed extramurally by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

This project conducts basic research in areas that will expand the capabilities of intelligent mobile robotic systems for military applications with a focus on enhanced, innate intelligence, ultimately approaching that of a dog or other intelligent animal, to permit unmanned systems to function as productive members of a military team.  Research is conducted in machine perception, including the exploration of sensor phenomenology, and the investigation of basic machine vision algorithms enabling future unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment for enhanced mobility and tactical performance; intelligent control, including the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques for robot behaviors permitting future systems to autonomously adapt, and alter their behavior to dynamic tactical situations; understanding the interaction of humans with machines focusing upon intuitive control by Soldiers to minimize cognitive burden; dexterous manipulation of the environment by unmanned systems; and unique modes of mobility to enable unmanned systems to seamlessly navigate complex or highly constrained three dimensional environments.  The program will conduct both analytic and validation studies.  \n\nWork in this projects builds fundamental knowledge for and complements the companion applied technology program, PE 0602120A, project TS2 (Robotics).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&T investment strategy.  ITC 'technology finds' are submitted as technology information papers (TIPs) to various Army S&T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development.  The ITC TIPs also serve as input into the international section of the Army S&T Master Plan.  The FTAS program builds upon the TIPs submitted by the ITCs.  In some cases the TIP is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&T investments.  In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to fund basic research in these technology areas identified by the TIPs as having potential relevance to the Army's S&T plan.  The research will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&T strategy.  \n\nWork in this project related to the USMA Basic Research Center for Network Science is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0601104\/Project H50 (Network Science CTA). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n       \nWork in this project is performed by Headquarters, Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD, and the United States Military Academy, NY."

The ISN emphasizes revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The ISN works in close collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Army's Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), and other Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) elements, as well as several major industrial partners, including Raytheon and DuPont, in pursuit of its goals.  This project emphasizes revolutionary materials research toward an advanced uniform concept.  The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n    \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Lab (ARL) in Adelphi, MD."

These activities are consolidated within the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) that links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to present the Army to a larger pool of technical talent and to provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes to fill future Army Science and Technology workforce needs. AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in science, mathematics, and engineering at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences. This project enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.\n\nIn FY13, activities and funds for educational outreach are consolidated PE65803\/729 into this PE 61104\/J14.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus area, the Army Modernization Strategy, the Department of Defense STEM Educational Outreach Strategic Plan and the President's \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign for STEM education.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), and Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), and the United States Military Academy (USMA)."

The Multiscale\/Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials consortium, led by University of Utah partnered with Boston University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, focuses on microscale properties to design macroscale behavior for electronics. Research at both CRAs will address the modeling and experimental challenges associated with developing multidisciplinary physics simulations across multiple length scales for materials to include: a limited ability to relate materials chemistry, structure, and defects to materials response and failure under extreme conditions; an inadequate ability to predict the roles of materials structure, processing, and properties on performance in relevant extreme environments and designs; and the lack of experimental capabilities to quantify multiscale response and failure of materials under extreme conditions.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
