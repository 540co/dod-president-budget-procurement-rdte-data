            "val": "Projects 090\/DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.\n\nMLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic\/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting BCT.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), and the AFOM, capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 kilometers (km).  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament and system hardware and software technologies, including COE and NIE, obsolesence mitigation, realiability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format. \n\nGMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the MLRS and HIMARS launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  \n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of four separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) that is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY15.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.\n\nGMLRS Increment IV is being developed to replace expiring Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles and ATACMS cluster munitions that are prohibited from use by the DoD Cluster Munitions Policy after 31 Dec 2018. It is intended to address the same targets with similar capabilities.  The program is currently in the pre-Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Phase. The MDD is anticipated to occur in 1Q FY2014 with a tentative Milestone A scheduled for 1Q FY16.\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Army funds GMLRS Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) activities from three program codes under the MLRS Product Improvement Program (0603778A) program element; 784-Guided MLRS includes common GMLRS RDT&E activities, 78G-GMLRS Alternative Warhead for GMLRS AW EMD activities, and DZ8-GMLRS Increment 4 for the Technology Demonstration (TD) activities."

The IAC effort, begun in FY 12, fulfills a M270A1 system requirement that enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government. The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Obsolescence mitigation activities in FY12 included trade studies to determine the most appropriate architecture for the FCS-U.  The FCS-U effort began in FY13, utilizing the industrial Engineering Services contract that was previously sole source awarded.  Contract efforts includes finalizing design, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY15.  PDR will occur in FY13 and CDR FY14."

GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.\n\nThe GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding is requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016."

The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications.  HIMARS has been deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units."

Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, and mitigating obsolescence of the fire control system through the integration of the FCS-U effort on the M142 HIMARS.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current capability of firing the complete set of MFOM per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Obsolescence mitigation activities in FY14 include trade studies to determine the most appropriate architecture for the FCS-U. The FCS-U effort which began in FY13 for the M270A1 system, will be integrated on the HIMARS system starting in FY15. Contract efforts include integration, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY16. Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) will occur in FY15 with qualified design in FY16.   HIMARS follow-on technology insertion efforts include automotive chassis life cycle enhancements, fire control system obsolescence mitigation and associated enhancements to training devices as improvements when applicable."
