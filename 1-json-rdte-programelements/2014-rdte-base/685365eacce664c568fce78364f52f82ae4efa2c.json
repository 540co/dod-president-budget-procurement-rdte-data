            "val": "The Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhances force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control station.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remove Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the SUAS products. \n\nA SUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch\/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller.  This equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.\n\nThe SUAS RDT&E budget line includes funding for studies and incremental development\/upgrade of current SUAS capabilities that will capitalize on new technology insertions based on identified user requirements.  Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability, introduced in 2010, which provided data link security, increased the number of communications channels allowing more aircraft to operate in close proximity, extended range through data link relay capability, and integrated gimbaled payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet Warfighter needs.  FY 2014 and future improvements will address enhancements to the system to support Army modernization initiatives and the service emphasis on Squad- Foundation of the Decisive Force.  Development of a government purpose rights control device compatible with current and future SUAS platforms and integrated into tactical networks is required.  Compatibility with Nett Warrior elements will support seamless transmission of data between squad members and adjacent and higher commands.  A communications relay capability for SUAS will extend the operational connectivity of the squad when ground based communications cannot support the ranges due terrain or atmospherics.  The relay capability supports the Aerial Layer Network Transport Initial Capabilities Document for low altitude requirements.  Development of a sensor to shooter capability will link forward edge combatants to organic and supporting fires networks with rapid dissemination of target information and imagery.  Efforts to reduce the workload required to operate the SUAS will free the soldiers to perform their primary mission while retaining the advantages afforded by the SUAS. Improved autonomy, to include GPS and comms denied environments will be sought through leverage of software, processor, and communications enhancements.   \n\nJustification:  FY2014 funds of $2.321 million will provide engineering services efforts and continue to focus on communication link encryption, network integration, interoperability, system vulnerability, and improved flight duration."
