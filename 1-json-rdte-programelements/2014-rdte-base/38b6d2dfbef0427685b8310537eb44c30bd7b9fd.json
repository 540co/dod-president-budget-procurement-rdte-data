A significant effort will be on building Army (consistent with DoD) C4\/IT technical standards-compliant Army data repositories that are web-accessible but secure.  These repositories will be consistent with DoD standards and policies and virtually appear to be a single repository for Army C4\/IT architecture products.  \n\nTo support the Army Vice Chief of Staff (VCSA) and the Army Chief Information Officer\/G6, as cited in the AEA Master Plan, this initiative fulfills the Clinger-Cohen Act mandate of developing sound integrated Information Technology (IT) architectures and the Army's Software Blocking Policy. The increased combat power of the Future Force will be dependent on the information superiority of network & knowledge centric warfare and the ability of systems to be fully -interoperable as a member of the joint, multinational, interagency team as well as emerging Future Force (FF) C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Systems. It identifies and reduces interoperability issues earlier in the life cycle by intra-Army\/FF\/Joint\/combined experiments and assessments, and through the establishment & sustainment of common standards.  This Army wide effort directly supports the management, oversight, development, maintenance, and interoperability of the Army enterprise level C4I\/IT architecture efforts required to implement Software Blocking and Army Enterprise Architecture (AEA).  Specifically, this project resources the Army's messaging standards conformance authority in assessing compliance with the Defense Information Systems Repository (DISR), in meeting the warfighter information exchange requirements and in facilitating their interoperability.  It also resources, in accordance with the DISR, the development and maintenance of the following information standards: Variable Message Format (VMF) & Combat Net Radio (CNR) protocol, which support Army\/Joint ground operations; Tactical Digital Information Links (TADILs), which support Air Defense operations; and US Message Text Format (USMTF), which support Intel and Commanders operations.  It provides the Army's lead for configuration management functions of these standards and test tools at both Army and Joint levels.  This project resources the Army participation in joint\/allied messaging certification testing & configuration management processes.  This project also resources the development and fielding of a suite of four (4) crucial tools which are used throughout the entire Army. These tools which are currently under development will provide the ideal means to: a) validate Technical Architecture\/Technical Reference Model (TA\/TRM) critical messaging and protocol standards; b) improve systems interoperability; c) verify\/certify correct system implementations and interpretation to TA\/TRM; d) sustain\/support digitization and transition of fielded systems; e) support Software Blocking and interoperability testing; f) provide Legacy AEA interoperability with Future Combat System (FCS) command and control systems.  These crucial tools are critical to the TA\/TRM Compliance, Certification Testing mission & Interoperability programs.  The task also supports the Army's transformation campaign while mitigating interoperability issues resulting in reducing cost & program slippages.  This project also provides the Configuration Management & Control for the Software Blocking (SWB)\/USF (Unit Set Fielding)."
