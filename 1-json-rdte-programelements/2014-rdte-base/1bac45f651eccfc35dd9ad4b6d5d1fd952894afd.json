Provides for rapid implementation of US BICES capabilities into the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) and the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) intelligence decision applications and data mechanisms in support of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) mission to ensure necessary intelligence information is being acquired, analyzed, and disseminated rapidly amongst our allies and coalition partners.  Develop US BICES as the \"enduring\" coalition intelligence support element of the DI2E.  Continues the development of the Trusted Network Environment (TNE) multi-level security database, web, and e-mail capabilities for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM).  Supports the research and development of 50+ High Assurance Connection Interfaces to Combatant Command identified bi-lateral and multi-lateral partners, develops the multi-level security rule sets and develops Ozone Widget Framework with applicable cloud widgets that can transverse the multi-level security boundaries.  Develops, test, and integrate intelligence mission applications that interface with and support the development of the DoD\/CIO Future Mission Network."
