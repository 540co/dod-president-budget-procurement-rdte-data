The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the JTRS JPEO.  The funding for the program resides in the Navy budget.   Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the Department of Defense family of common software-defined programmable radios that will form the foundation of radio frequency information transmission for Joint Vision 2020.  JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and provide the warfighter with additional communications capability to access maps and other visual data, communicate via voice and video and obtain information directly from battlefield sensors.  JTRS will provide internet protocol (IP)-based capability to the warfighter and will replace all existing tactical radios based on the Services' migration plans.  The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability.  JTRS is a key enabler that will provide dynamic connectivity throughout the battle space to operate within the network centric operational environment.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), currently it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

Each of the joint services, including the Air Force, transfers its funding to the Navy's budget under Joint Tactical Radio System Program (PE 0604280N, BA 5) via RMD. This annual transfer of funds to the Navy PE is the cause of the seemingly drastic change from current ($65M in FY13, and $30M in FY14) to future fiscal years. The reduction in funding in RDT&E predicted from FY 2013 to 2014 is based upon the anticipated maturation of program development."
