The Defense-Wide IO Program Review revalidated a requirement for an integrated range supporting exercises, testing, and development of IO capabilities.  Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an integrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.  The 2006 National Security Strategy identifies \"Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly state the need to expand IO\/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO\/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO\/Cyber capabilities."
