            "val": "With the successful launch of two Space Tracking and Surveillance System Demonstration (STSS-D) Satellites in 2009, the agency has on-orbit capability to validate remote sensor and fire control integration to inform the design and operation of future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer capabilities, to characterize contribution of space data into the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architecture, and to provide sensor measurements and background data supporting trade studies and analyses for future MDA space-layer options and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) IIB development. Lessons learned from the two STSS-D satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable, continuously available, future operational constellation and ground communications\/processing system. \n\nSTSS-D is providing risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options models, algorithms, sensors and spacecraft development by providing background and clutter scene characterization, complex target signatures, interface definition, communications architectures, and performance across acquisition, tracking, and discrimination. STSS-D is also providing definition to BMDS Concept of Operations, timelines and performance requirements for sensor cuing and weapons engagement such as Aegis Launch On\/Engage On from remote space sensors. \n\nSTSS-D will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats the Agency expects to encounter in the far term. The greatest protection against missile defense threats of all ranges remains a highly available early missile tracking capability from space. Space sensors provide the most cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement, directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS-D is a capability development activity for the demonstration of technologies to support development and capability delivery of future MDA space-layer options.  In addition, the STSS-D satellites have demonstrated the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision, real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects, thus enabling simultaneous regional, theater, and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going STSS-D testing has validated the ability to track cold, midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Flight Tests, STSS-D has provided data in real-time that has met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems Quality of Service (QoS) data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized (REA). Finally, STSS-D provides a new infrared sensor phenomenology for the BMDS that will demonstrate the benefit of future MDA space-layer capabilities when combined with radars that will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. \n\nMissile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed, and is testing, two STSS-D satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors in support of future MDA space-layer options risk reduction. STSS-D Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. Element testing is based on an integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program. Element systems, subsystems, and components were tested early in development and this testing was necessary prior to conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) level testing. Key data from the STSS-D satellites efforts continue to provide lessons learned as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs. \n- Space sensors BMDS sensor coverage to a global level. The STSS-D has demonstrated the capability of satellites to track ballistic missiles and the ability to provide accurate tracking information to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) battle manager to close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors, thus extending the effective range of BMDS interceptors and other sensors. \n- Space-based sensors are not limited by basing rights issues or deployment decisions, and will allow cost effective coverage of countries and large areas not accessible from ground based sensors. \n- Space based visible and Infrared (IR) sensors will complement radars and contribute to a sensor architecture more robust to countermeasures \n- Space-based sensors will enable near continuous threat observation and tracking from launch to intercept, covering threats by augmenting the coverage of the BMDS radars, and providing state vectors to Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to enable interceptor fire control via multiple BMDS assets (Aegis, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) \n\nGoals for STSS-D \n- Risk reduction for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer architectures by demonstrating Aegis Launch on Remote in FY 2013\n- Risk reduction for future MDA space-layer architectures by demonstrating the ability to cue or be cued\n- Demonstrate C2BMC interfaces, sensor registration, communication chains and latencies to support future MDA space-layer concept of operations development \n\nNear Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) \nThe NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. MDA used this data to validate the models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the guidance and endgame homing algorithms. NFIRE is now focused on future MDA space-layer sensors risk reduction and other BMDS element development support by collecting background, clutter, and target signatures for modeling and algorithm development and validation. A secondary objective of the experiment has been to collect hyper-temporal short wave infrared and visible data for assessing early launch detection and tracking capability. The experiment includes three plume signature mission types: targets of opportunity, dedicated fly-bys, and ground observations. The dedicated fly-by experiments have been accomplished. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal, which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the BMDS. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance. \n\nGoals for NFIRE \n- Conduct multiple data collection missions from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) against ground, air, space and ballistic missile targets of opportunity \n- Conduct low earth orbit satellite-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground laser communication experiments \n- Provide data to validate models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the navigation, guidance and control, and endgame homing algorithms, as well as laser communication proof of concept \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

                            "val": "Space Tracking and Surveillance System Demonstration Satellites (STSS-D) \nThe STSS-D satellites provide two on-orbit satellite assets with visible and infrared sensors in low earth orbit for testing with other Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) elements. These two satellites provide valuable risk reduction for acquisition, tracking, and discrimination functionality to include stereo data fusion, cueing radars over the horizon and over-the-horizon fire control. The program is demonstrating the functions and interfaces required for space data delivery to the BMDS, validating the data quality necessary for interceptors to launch and\/or engage on STSS-D sensor data. The two Demonstration Satellites are operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from the ground station processing center at the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) with a government and contractor team. On-orbit, STSS-D satellites continue data collection and analyses in FY 2012 and beyond striving to view all available Targets of Opportunity (TOOs) to include participation with other BMDS target and flight tests that provide demonstration of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Space Layer capabilities and allow collection of future system risk reduction information. \n\nThe satellites are demonstrating key functions of missile tracking with space sensors in support of future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer capabilities risk reduction. On-orbit sensor operations are collecting invaluable background, scene and target signatures to support future MDA space-layer and other weapon sensor development trade studies. STSS-D activities support future MDA space-layer capabilities development by integration of space-based missile tracking (midcourse phases); sensor and weapons cueing (such as Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) via Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC); features and discrimination; and hit\/impact point assessments into C2BMC. STSS-D risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options will enable early capability assessment of the Warfighter`s need for a highly available early missile tracking capability from space providing an operationally suitable means of global persistent surveillance and engagement. Capabilities being assessed for future MDA space-layer capabilities include detecting and acquiring ballistic missiles; tracking ballistic missiles and their deployed objects; emerging threat detection and tracking; performing autonomous acquisition-to-track handover within a satellite; performing tracking handover to a satellite from a ground cue; performing uplink and downlink of mission, health, and status data both directly and via crosslink between two satellites; reporting ballistic missile and intercept event to close the fire-control loop; filtering reports to C2BMC; providing near real-time object data to external users; and providing a System Performance Evaluation Tool model. As such, the demonstration of these activities will support future MDA space-layer capability development and will enable meeting a Warfighter`s requirements to include tracking missile threats and objects of interest; provide post-launch sensor cueing; integrate, fuse and correlate sensor data; engage\/re-engage ballistic missile threats; and provide system modeling tools. \n\nMDA Element testing is based on an integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program. Element systems, subsystems, and components are tested early in development and are necessary prior to conducting BMDS level testing. The STSS-D Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in this Program Element (PE) submission. The STSS-D satellites demonstrate key functions of space sensors. The MDA will continue planning for and conducting integrated BMDS intercept tests based on track data passed from the STSS Demonstration Satellites through C2BMC to Aegis, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), or other interceptors. The Advanced Space Operations Development includes activities to reduce risk for future space integration and exploitation demonstrating expected architectures, capabilities, Concept of Operations, timelines, etc. \n\nNear Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) \nFunding for On-Orbit Operations and cooperative tests are planned to continue pending a positive assessment of the NFIRE satellite`s health and utility. Participation is planned for tests in the Integrated Master Test Plan to include Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) intercept using Space Tracking and Surveillance System Demonstration Satellites (STSS-D) as a remote sensor.\n\nThe NFIRE satellite is operated from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) and continues to collect environmental background characterization (regional\/seasonal atmospheric radiance variability, day-night, land-sea clutter, clouds, auroral measurements, etc) for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer sensors and SM-3 IIB seeker development programs, hyper-temporal short wave infrared data to support research and development of early launch detection and tracking capabilities, and earth limb radiance measurements to support improvement of environmental models. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These communications experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite laser communications capabilities for potential incorporation into the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS). The laser communication experiments will be conducted on a non-interference basis with other MDA missions. MDA will continue to assess the health\/utility of the NFIRE satellite on an annual basis to determine whether to continue NFIRE operations and testing. \n\nLessons learned and data gathered from the STSS-D program and the NFIRE program will continue to provide valuable information for future MDA space-layer modeling and simulation activities in assessing the capability of a low earth orbit constellation to complement sensor coverage and missile detection and tracking capabilities provided by Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) sensors."
