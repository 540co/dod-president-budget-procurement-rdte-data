            "val": "Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M). TACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market. Therefore, requirements are frequently adjusted to accomodate warfighter needs while working within available funding. The TACP-M program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a command and control (C2) link for close air support (CAS), airlift, and Air Force surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with various targeting and communications equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, joint fire assets, C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms\/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties, TACPs detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  \n\nThe TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACPs, Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), and Tactical Operations Center (TOC) personnel. The program supports Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives.\n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flow\/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF \/VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, dismounted and mounted. The mounted segment is further divided into fixed and mobile elements. \n\nThe software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command & control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16) to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACPs for the execution of joint fire support mission. In addition, TACP-M is working with various contractors and laboratories to conduct demonstrations and risk reduction efforts to assess advanced HMI and interoperability technologies for future fielding. \n\nThe dismounted segment consists of integrated systems and equipment comprised of non-developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which are carried by dismounted TACP. These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators, manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. \n\nThe mounted (fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) gateway, gateway lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP-M Mounted (mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  \n\nFollowing the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, the TACP community has capability gaps in vehicle mounted communications systems.  As a result, and based on ACC priorities and available funding, the TACP-M team is working through the JCIDS process with ACC to identify and resolve capability gaps related to vehicle mounted communications, which is referred to as the Mobile Communications System (MCS).  These gaps are being addressed in a stepwise fashion:  an initial implementation of a very limited, PRC-117G-based, voice-only capability in approximately 220 TACP HMMWVs that were originally slated for the VCS.  This limited capability is referred to as the Voice Communications Package (VCP), and replaces the more capable Mobile Communications Package (MCP) that was going to take multiple years to implement.  A more robust capability, implementing voice and data communications through additional PRC-117G and PRC-150 radios, computers, streaming video, and advanced soldier radio waveforms, will follow as the requirement is formalized, funding becomes available and contracts can be awarded to fill the long-term need.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  \n\nThe TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACPs, Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), and Tactical Operations Center (TOC) personnel. The program supports Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives.\n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flow\/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF \/VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software, dismounted and mounted. The mounted segment is further divided into fixed and mobile elements. \n\nThe software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command & control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16) to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACPs for the execution of joint fire support mission. In addition, TACP-M is working with various contractors and laboratories to conduct demonstrations and risk reduction efforts to assess advanced HMI and interoperability technologies for future fielding. \n\nThe dismounted segment consists of integrated systems and equipment comprised of non-developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which are carried by dismounted TACP. These include laser range finders, thermal imagers, laser designators, manpack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. \n\nThe mounted (fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) gateway, gateway lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP-M Mounted (mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  \n\nFollowing the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11, the TACP community has capability gaps in vehicle mounted communications systems.  As a result, and based on ACC priorities and available funding, the TACP-M team is working through the JCIDS process with ACC to identify and resolve capability gaps related to vehicle mounted communications, which is referred to as the Mobile Communications System (MCS).  These gaps are being addressed in a stepwise fashion:  an initial implementation of a very limited, PRC-117G-based, voice-only capability in approximately 220 TACP HMMWVs that were originally slated for the VCS.  This limited capability is referred to as the Voice Communications Package (VCP), and replaces the more capable Mobile Communications Package (MCP) that was going to take multiple years to implement.  A more robust capability, implementing voice and data communications through additional PRC-117G and PRC-150 radios, computers, streaming video, and advanced soldier radio waveforms, will follow as the requirement is formalized, funding becomes available and contracts can be awarded to fill the long-term need.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
