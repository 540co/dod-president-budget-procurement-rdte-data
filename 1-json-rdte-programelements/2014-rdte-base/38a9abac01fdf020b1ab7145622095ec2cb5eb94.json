Technologies to be developed include blast, fragmentation, penetrating and low-collateral damage warheads, hard target fuzing, precise terminal guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies"
