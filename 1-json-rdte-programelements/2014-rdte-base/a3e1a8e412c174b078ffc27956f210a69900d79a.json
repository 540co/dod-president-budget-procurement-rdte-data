It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department\u2019s return on investment in information technology resources and to effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation.  \n\nThis budget line was transferred from DoD Chief Information Officer management oversight to that of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and\nLogistics) as part of the disestablishment of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD(NII)) and the associated transfer to\nUSD (AT&L) of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communications, Command and Control and Cyber (DASD C3 & Cyber.) Transfer of this DASD to\nUSD(AT&L) conveys the critical technical, systems engineering and program management oversight division of the former ASD(NII) to AT&L where engineering and acquisition expertise is resident. It capitalizes on each organization\u2019s performance and reduces technical and operational risk in the Department\u2019s acquisition processes by incorporating recognized, solid experience in the application of best practices to the development and fielding of net-centric capabilities which support major systems and weapons deployment."

Likewise performed a requirements trade and platform integration assessment for eXtended Data Rate (XDR) terminals and a technical evaluation of viable SATCOM options in 2016 and 2028 in degraded environments due to cyber\/kinetic issues.\n\u2013  SATCOM Analysis and Optimization: Provided performance, cost, and risk analysis of ongoing SATCOM programs such as UFO, DSCS, WGS, MUOS, AEHF and EPS.  Identified risk mitigation approaches.\n\u2013  Integrated Master Schedule Environment (IMSE):  Significantly increased IMSE capability to include command and control, as well as major defense acquisition programs for supporting acquisition events such as IPT\/OIPT\/DAES reviews and to evaluate the impact on capability deliveries based on key acquisition milestones, test events and production decisions. \n\u2013  Ground\/Air\/Space Network Performance:  Assessed aerial layer waveforms (Link 16, TTNT, CDL) for lowering cost and complexity in implementation and to harmonize tactical datalinks and ISR networks. Provided technical risk assessments for waveform implementation (WNW, SRW, SINCGARS, HNW) and ground force IP routing network architectures. \n\u2013 QCDI Model Extension:  updated the model\u2019s typical data rates to a range, distribution, and\/or agent based time variant representation to account for variations among users within a class. \n\u2013 Aerial Networks Roadmaps: Developed roadmaps to guide the evolution of aerial networks so that DoD takes full advantage of 5th generation fighters and the force multiplier effects of networking aircraft. Address air-air high capability transport and air-air tactical and air-ground\/air-space domains.\n\u2013 Ground Networking Roadmaps: Developed roadmaps to guide the evolution of ground networking radios and waveforms. Addressed  lower echelon and brigade\/backbone domains.\n\u2013 SATCOM Common Systems Roadmap: Developed roadmaps to guide the evolution of SATCOM common systems for a more resilient gateway infrastructure with lower operating costs and the ability to reprovision resources within minutes vice days and hours. Address gateway evolution and resource management domains.   \n\u2013 C2 Capability Planning, Technical Development and Reference Model:  Established tracking mechanisms to assess C2 data implementation cost and progress and funded secure data tagging to support Joint C2 and Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX).
