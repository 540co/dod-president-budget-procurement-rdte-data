Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation\/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD\/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities\/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. \n\nAdditionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.
