            "val": "Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information Systems (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation\u2019s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events.  G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon and is intended to replace all existing TSCMIS solutions hosted at and supporting more than 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies and Combatant Commands (CCDRs).  It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) Section 804 that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). \n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding. \n\nG-TSCMIS interfaces with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM) and Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems.  G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three or four sub-iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020."

Release 1, Iteration 1 software, developed in eight Sprints, was delivered to the government after a successful Contractor Software Integration Test (CSIT) with participation of users from multiple activities.  This risk reduction activity provided early user feedback to the development contractor and enabled functional testing of developed capabilities, along with Information Assurance (IA) testing to identify trouble reports for early mitigation.\n\u00a0\nPrepared for FY 2013 Release 2 Build Decision by having Joint Staff (JS) J6 validate all Release 2 functional and architectural requirements.  Commenced revision of acquisition documentation to support this future Build Decision.  Collected software metrics and sunk cost information to refine cost estimate, monitor Should Cost initiatives and oversee contract execution.\n\u00a0\nDrafted Test and Evaluation Master Plan and coordinated review and revisions with operational test community.  Developed Training System Plan (TSP) and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) and achieved successful Independent Logistics Assessment (ILA).  Conducted a Product Support Business Case Analysis (BCA) to assess and choose the best value approach for supporting G-TSCMIS.\n\u00a0\nImproved user access to existing TSCMIS capabilities by developing a Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR), web-based architecture and enterprise hosting of existing TSCMIS software. Completed security accreditation for the Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR )version and provided updates to the software product.

Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G-TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2018. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards.  Releases 3 through 5 will be completed by separate contract(s).   Either another IDIQ MAC or MACs will be used or a new contract or contracts will be created for the final 3 releases."

JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE\/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet.  Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program.   The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational.  Additional statistics based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&V and Developmental tests validate system performance.\n\nMajor Performers:\nScience Applications International Corportation (SAIC) for Release 1 and 2 software development\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) for program support;  Sentek Global for systems engineering support"
