            "val": "This program element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and booby traps. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft, and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems; imaging systems; and advanced radio frequency (RF)\/electro-optical (EO)\/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. \n\nWork in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0603270A (EW Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC),  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize booby traps. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, Soldier and Air portfolios.\n\nWork in this project is complimentary of PE 0603270A (EW Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
