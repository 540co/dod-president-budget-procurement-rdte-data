            "val": "Information Asurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise.  This entails architecture studies,system integration, testing, certification, and accreditation of COMSEC systems and equipment.  COMSEC technology ensures total signal and data security for all Army information systems to include any operational enhancement and specialized Army configurations.  The program also assesses, develops, and integrates COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure posts, camp or station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nG6 OA22 Funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and information assurance (IA) technologies developed under the direction of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Services, and commercial developers to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to identify fundamental building blocks for Army IA solutions. \n\nArmy Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) to automate the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) key management control and distribution, thereby limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. Numerous software applications are being fielded on separate laptops, thus, burdening the units with the management of numerous laptops. In an effort to reduce the number of laptops in the field, Joint Tactical Network Environment NetOps Toolkit (J-TNT) provides a consolidated platform that hosts the numerous planning, monitoring and network management tools onto one J-TNT box. The J-TNT AN\\GYK-33 V1 system is a laptop platform comprised of a suite of Commerical off the Shelf (COTS) and Government off the Shelf (GOTS) software applications.  The suite of applications provides the soldier the capability to plan, monitor and manage COMSEC, Signal Operation Instruction\/Joint Communications-Electronics Operations Instructions (SOI\/JCEOI), network radio waveform configurations, loadsets and spectrum.  From one platform, the J-TNT system provides the soldier the essential tools needed to complete critical battlefield missions operating on the tactical network.\n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) provides an integrated, operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band. KMI achieves an over the network key (OTNK) management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI System supporting DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives.  The Mission Planning\/ Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter.\n\nThe Crypto System program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible."

NSA's aging EKMS infrastructure is being replaced with the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) by Dec. 2017, requiring the transition of 425 Army accounts from FY2013 to FY2017. AKMS supports the transition to the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) during this timeframe. A critical component of this transition is the Mission Planning\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) which creates a secure, highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. Updates to the MP\/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the interface continue through FY2014. The MP\/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management, and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner. \n\nThe additional MP\/MSS capabilities projected to be developed include 1) adding the missing mission planning data fields based on the Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) evaluation of Sprint 9\/Release 1, 2) completing the Release 1 backlog along with the other core software requirements related to security, and 3) adding the access controls based on the current login procedures (via medium assurance Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Login\/Password and KMI certificate)."

LCMS hardware refresh began 2QFY10. Current LCMS software is v5.1.0.5, which completes fielding in 2013. The AKMS acquisition strategy to procure Simple Key Loaders (SKL) was updated in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approved by the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) 3QFY02. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) began SKL Post Development Software (PDSS) efforts in 1QFY09 and release software upgrades annually.  In FY 2010, an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) was initiated to modify the current SKL design in order to meet emerging requirements of modern end cryptographic units and Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS). Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) is currently undergoing a hardware refresh. Continued enhancements and support of AKMS next generation software tools to meet emerging Army systems' requirements are also underway. ACES is currently operating on version 3.1. SKL is currently operating on version 8.0. AKMS supports the transition from NSA's EKMS infrastructure to the new Key Management Infrastructure (KMI)."

The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI System supporting Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives.  The Mission Planning\/ Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the WarFighter. Updates relative to Key Management requirements to the MP\/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the interface are scheduled to begin in FY2014. The MP\/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner.\n\nAdditional MP\/MSS capabilities projected to be developed include 1) registration of MP\/MSS identities, 2) validations required for digital signature based on KMI and other medium assurance Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 3) allowing the exchange of an electronic equivalent of a signed SF-153 (Hand Receipt, Destruction, Inventory, etc) and 4) integrating MP\/MSS Application Program Interface (API) into the Army Mission Planner - Joint Tactical Network Environment NetOps Toolkit (JTNT)."
