This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a level of effort to support a balanced and rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: Common Mission Framework (CMF), platforms, access, and capabilities. The program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national IO agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in following information and cyberspace superiority core areas: influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations. OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM Operational Directive 12-001, and the AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories. Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to mature systems to full operational capability or sustain fielded systems."
