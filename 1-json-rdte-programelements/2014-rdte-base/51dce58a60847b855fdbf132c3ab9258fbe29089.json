Through advanced mathematics and engineering methodologies, the Joint Interoperability Directorate will work to institutionalize joint interoperability concepts throughout the DoD to ensure reduced fratricide, increased force effectiveness, and decreased taxpayer cost through fully interoperable weapons remains a focus throughout the acquisition and program development processes.  Working closely with programs in the advanced technology development phase, this effort will result in reviews of program technology feasibility from an interoperability perspective and push to proof of concept through prototyping and modeling.\n\nJoint Interoperability has additional efforts to develop advanced mathematics techniques to manage large volumes of sensor data to solve DoD Battlefield challenges, to review new interoperability technologies, and to review program documentation not only to ensure a joint and interoperable approach, but also to mature technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges.\n\nFunding for this Program Element ends in FY 2012."

Joint interoperability is the force multiplier that will enable our warfighters to fight jointly, be more efficient and effective in the battlespace, and allow warfighters to fight in the battle and not the tactical Command, Control, and Communications (C3) displays.  Sharing of systems and information across Services, and with coalition and non-DoD partners, has the benefit of a more rapid and better coordinated response to an ever more agile adversary.  It also enables the full exploitation of our costly (legacy and future) weapon systems at full kinematic range and makes full use of the assets in theater.  The taxpayers also benefit from reducing the cost of weapon system procurement by paying once versus multiple times for weapons systems that are used by Services in the battlespace."

They will develop novel approaches to implement non-classical methods to solve computationally intensive problems like fusing numerous sensors that are generating terabytes of data in Afghanistan.  Our ability to sense has far exceeded our ability to process data into information.  Developing algorithms that are more computationally efficient at discerning information from large datasets will place smaller demands on our limited bandwidth and better enable the disadvantaged user to get information down to the tactical level.  This effort includes tests against recorded live data to demonstrate relevance to identified military needs."
