The HD R&D Program is the only U.S. organization conducting research and development for Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) detection and mechanical clearance technologies.  HMA is a critical component of stability operations, which HD R&D directly supports by speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the post-conflict threat to host nation population and U.S. forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries.  \n\nThe HD R&D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, integrates mature technologies, and leverages R&D activity within DoD, particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine\/UXO detection, technical survey\/area reduction, mechanical mine\/UXO clearance, vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Evaluations of HD R&D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for U.S. military countermine R&D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to worldwide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 160 evaluations in 36 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 18+ million sq meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 80,000+ mines and UXO; and provided 280,000 mine\/UXO disposal charges with 33 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.\n\nUnder the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO\/LIC), the HD R&D Program works closely with the U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter.  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO\/LIC.

New developments include the latest ground penetrating radar and magnetic sensing technologies to detect mines and UXO among high densities of clutter; semi-autonomous platforms and advanced perception sensors to aid in navigation and detection operations; and Sparrow and Armtrac ground-engaging\/rapid investigation tools for mine\/UXO suspect areas."
