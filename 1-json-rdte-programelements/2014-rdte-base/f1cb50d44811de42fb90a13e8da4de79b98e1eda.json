Provided instrumentation, data collection, data capture, real-time mission monitoring, and feedback to participants via daily debriefings. Benefits include improved ability to assess various participating coalition and US systems, improved joint task execution, and an effective assessment of emergent U.S. C2 information systems while greatly reducing the timeline required to provide fact-based recommendations.\n-Teamed with U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command to conduct DOT&E directed interoperability and mission assurance assessments for USEUCOM during Exercise Austere Challenge 12.  Objective was to investigate and recommend solutions to identified interoperability issues between Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) and Global Command and Control System \u2013 Joint (GCCS-J) impacting the Joint Common Operational Picture.  Provided data collection, analysis, and display using JDAT developed tools in the air and space operations center during the event function test.  At the request of a participating Nation, exercise execution was delayed from May 2012 to Nov 2012.\n- Teamed with U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command to conduct a DOT&E directed interoperability assessment for USSOUTHCOM during Exercise PANAMAX 2012.  Objective was to investigate and recommend solutions to identified interoperability issues between Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) and Global Command and Control System \u2013 Joint (GCCS-J) impacting the Joint Common Operational Picture.  Provided data collection, analysis, and display using JDAT developed tools in the air and space operations center during the event function test.  Benefit includes improvement in the Joint Force Commander\u2019s Common Operational Picture.\n-Provided analytical support to assess technology integration and interoperability during JIAMDO Joint Tactical Air Picture spiral 1 event.  This was a risk reduction event for the assessment to be conducted in November 2012.  Provided data collection, analysis and display using JDAT developed tools.  Benefit includes an improved tactical air picture for battle-space managers.  \n- Executed three risk reduction events (Joint Operational Test Approach 1, USAF Exercise Red Flag 12-3 and USAF Weapons School Mission Event 12A) in preparation for Department of Defense Joint Operational Test Approach (JOTA) 2, which is the Interim Operational Capability (IOC) event for Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1.  JDAT, as the lead analytical organization in support of Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) during JOTA 2, validated integration and interoperability of fielded Mode 5 systems. Developed data collection and analysis methodologies, design and determine data collection architectures that meet JOTA 2 objectives.  Benefit includes efficient Mode 5 data collection and analysis techniques for all weapons systems during JOTA 2.\n-Provided C2 data collection and analytical support to the Joint Fires Support Executive Steering Committee (JFS ESC). Chaired the ESC chartered Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS) Engineering Change Implementation Group. Conducted Digitally Aided Close Air Support (DACAS) Coordinated Implementation risk reduction assessments to validate service compliance with requisite Engineering Change Proposals. Planned and executed testing and validation of DACAS engineering change proposals and coordinated implementation across the Department of Defense and partner nations.  Benefit included recommendations for Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures in the areas of standardization and digital interoperability and development of associated Universal Joint Tasks\n-Provided policy updates to CJCSI 3265.01, Command and Control Governance and Management and CJCSM 3500.04, Universal Joint Task Manual.\n-Provided doctrine updates to JP 3-09.3, Close Air Support; JP 3-13, Information Operations; JP 3-33, Joint Task Force Headquarters; and JP 3-60, Joint Targeting\n- Provided subject matter expertise and tier 2 architecture products on development of the Joint Close Air Support (CAS) and Joint Fires Joint Mission Threads.\n-Developed the Track Event Reconstruction Application (TERA) to increase track-match accuracy and shorten analytical times for air picture assessments.\n-Provided observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations from field assessments and subject matter expert support to DOD forums and boards (Joint Mission Environment Test Capability Program, NATO Technical Panel 8, Joint Fire Support Executive Steering Committee, Combat Identification \u2013 Friendly Force Tracker Executive Steering Committee, Joint Mission Thread Architecture and Testing Working Group, and Joint C4I Partnership Working Group)in developing and advancing capabilities and products."
