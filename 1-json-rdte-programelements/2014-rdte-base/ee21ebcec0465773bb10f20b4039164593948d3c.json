            "val": "United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling & Simulation (M&S) Program Element (PE) is broken into four thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, Accelerated Acquisition, New and Emerging Warfighting Capabilities, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), acquisition excellence initiatives, and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability, accessibility, reuse, and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within Army, Navy, Marines, OSD, interagency, and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  \n\nLVC environments today are used as the most cost effective means to meet mission needs, the most practical means, and sometimes the only way.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 30,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red & Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, like 5th Generation (5th Gen) and beyond, which replicate high demand\/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. \n\nUSAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland, including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

MSF is the:  standards, policies, procedures, architectures, and tools that enable the rapid and efficient composition of distributed environments to support both the warfighter needs and the US Air Force's (USAF) functional communities of:  acquisition, training, planning, analysis, testing, education, and experimentation requirements.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  This also funds the USAF in its capacity as the Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Executive Agent (MSEA) for the Air and Space Natural Environment.  MSF's objective is to establish a USAF Live-Virtual-Constructive-Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) that provides a persistent network of constructive computer simulations, man-in-the-loop virtual simulators, and live forces\/resources in an interoperable environment that supports USAF organizations and the functional communities.  This objective will be achieved by MSF providing tools, standards and interfaces to be used by model developers and users to ensure efficiencies and model reuse.  \n\nMSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.  This is done by providing appropriate authoritative data and component representations. With the capability generated via MSF, users will readily access available repositories of reusable, validated, and integrated synthetic components.  Synthetic components include representations of operational battlespace entities (such as friendly and enemy assets) and representations of the natural environment that include the terrain, atmospheric and space weather effects; and energy and signal propagation effects.  The rapid composition is based on a durable common architecture framework, policies, and common standards.  MSF capability also supports:  efficient, cost-effective verification, validation, and accreditation activity across all of the M&S functional and organizational communities.   \n\nAs the DoD Air and Space Natural Environment Modeling and Simulation Executive Agent (ASNE MSEA), the Air Force coordinates all aspects of DoD M&S related to representations of the air and space natural environment.  The tools developed through this include the Environmental Scenario Generator, the Environmental Data Cube Support System, and the Space Weather Analysis.  ASNE MSEA collaborates with other national partners to provide the USAF and DoD access to authoritative natural environment scenarios necessary for robust \"What-if\" mission planning and rehearsal and for realistic training, analysis, and acquisition.  ASNE MSEA leads the development and execution of the DoD Integrated Natural Environment Authoritative Representation Process (INEARP) Concept of Operations.\n\nThe Information Operations Suite (IOS) provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and COCOM battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations.  Other capabilities, such as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) provide for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) training and exercise support by using virtual simulators and constructive models for command and staff level training.  These capabilities provide commanders, staffs, and operators with common training systems for the employment, tasking, exploitation and dissemination of imagery. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This included Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) infrastructure, tools and processes supporting LVC events, and models, tools, data, simulations\/stimulation that supported requirements definition, systems engineering and test activities.  Activities also included M&S support for studies and analysis that supported both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThese efforts enabled more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.  A key objective was to improve interoperability of weapon systems and platforms through continuing, rigorous interoperability evaluation in a representative Joint Mission Environment.  Additionally, AA activities sought to reduce risk associated with acquisition programs by influencing models, simulations, tools, data and infrastructure linking combat system engineering sites to facilitate concept exploration, development and assessment of systems in a net-centric mission context.  This provided the capability to improve both Service and Joint system performance in a system-of-systems environment.  Connectivity established by the infrastructure built upon existing Service and Joint combat system engineering and test sites, such as Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) hardware in the loop and computer-program-in-the-loop engineering sites (including design activities, software support activities, test & evaluation facilities and training commands).  \n\nDevelopment included concept of operations, business rules, and procedures that enabled acquisition managers to effectively use LVC capabilities.  These efforts enabled accurately represented C4I networks for capability requirement definition, development, and testing activities to evaluate those systems for interoperability and integration into a joint environment.  This addressed interoperability issues by providing a means for discovering issues early on. \n \nThis program was in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, this budget activity included development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production."

Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  \n\nIt includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  \n\nThe Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders (COCOM) battle staffs.  The primary model in the AFMSTT is the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM).  The Joint Training Transformation Initiative (JTTI) is a CSAF and Chief of Staff of the Army initiative to improve air, space, and cyberspace power fidelity to the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP), a US Army training event for senior commanders and their staffs, as well as improving ground component fidelity to AF operational-level exercises. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
