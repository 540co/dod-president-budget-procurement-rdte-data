Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; High Energy Laser System Test Facility (HELSTF), White Sands Test Center, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations.  This project also funds the Army's developmental test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. \nThis project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating cost not appropriately billed to test customers, recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances.  The developmental test capabilities at these test ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\nIn accordance with the FY03 NDAA, this project funds the indirect test costs associated with the rapid testing of systems and equipment needed in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), such as individual soldier protection equipment and up-armoring the Army's wheeled vehicle fleet.  This project sustains the developmental Test & Evaluation capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies.  Types of systems scheduled for developmental testing include; Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Directed Energy Weapons, Network Centric and Command, Control, and Communication.\nSpecific systems supported in FY13 with continued support in FY14 include:  Network Integration Evaluations (NIE), personnel protective equipment (including Body Armor), up-armoring vehicle ballistic protection on route clearance vehicles, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles Long Term Armor Strategy (FMTV LTAS), and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV); Stryker upgrades; armor gun shields for tactical vehicles; reactive and active armor; Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (XM25 ISAAS); the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles; Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Unitary Rocket; Counter Remote Control IED (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW); Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T); Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A); Aviation Transformation (AH-64 Block III); aviation protection systems (Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM), missile defense (PAC-3), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)); Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS); Unmanned Aerial Systems (Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, Extended Range Multi-Purpose, Hunter, RQ-16 Class I UAS, Long Endurance Multi-INT Vehicle (LEMV, Telluride, Raven)); Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), Grey Eagle, Kiowa Warrior Upgrades, CMWS Hostile Fire Indication, Excalibur, Green Ammo, Nett Warrior, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Aircraft Hostile Fire Detection System (HFDS), Paladin Integrated Management (PIM), and Longbow Hellfire Modular Missile System (LBHMMS)).\nDirect costs are borne by materiel developers in accordance with DoD Directive 3200.11 and DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R."
