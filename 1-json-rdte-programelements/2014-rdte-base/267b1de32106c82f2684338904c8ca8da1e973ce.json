Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

                                                "val": "The HSST project made significant advancements in ground and flight test technologies, techniques and instrumentation for both air-breathing propulsion and boost\/glide weapons, and developed innovative M&S tools.\n  The two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities were clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities could only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  As demonstrated by an HSST FY 2011 test, the resulting \u201cvitiated air\u201d had different gas properties than clean air and was not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affected the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable mach number capability was required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, began incorporation into a small-scale, clean air, true enthalpy, variable Mach number 5-8 aero propulsion test facility.  The completed facility would advance the component development to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and provide risk reduction for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the development including fabrication, installation, and integrated checkout of the advanced high-temperature refractory bricks, controls, and support systems for the Regenerative Storage Heater. Design efforts for subsequent phases were initiated.  These efforts included critical design of the air delivery system and preliminary design of a variable Mach number nozzle.\n   Innovative test techniques were developed to assess the viability of accurately testing large scramjet engines in existing size-limited national test facilities. One effort evaluated a means of truncating the long inlet section of an engine while still accurately replicating the performance of a larger baseline inlet.  Another effort evaluated how to quantify and improve the accuracy of direct connect and semi-free jet test techniques by comparing them to a benchmark free jet test configuration.  Engine operability and performance test results for each of the test facility configurations werequantified and compared to establish the first known database of engine\/test facility configuration scale effects on engine operation.  The aforementioned technology developments aimed to permit weapons system developers to maximize the use of existing infrastructure and better understand test results, thereby reducing flight test and acquisition risks.\n  Scramjet engine tests were completed to determine the facility effects of test duration, test media, and freejet versus direct-connect test methodology upon scramjet engine performance and operability.  Testing utilized scramjet engine flowpaths of the same design tested in impulse and blowdown ground test facilities.  This study culminates in the most extensive examination of hypersonic aero propulsion test methods yet accomplished and will enable significant improvements in the quality of data provided to weapon system developers and computational fluid dynamics tool developers.\n  Accurately predicting the ablation characteristics of a TPS was critical for developing maneuvering reentry and boost-glide vehicles.  A major aerothermal T&E capability gap existed in the mid-altitude\/mid-pressure flight regime which was representative of the flight corridor for these hypersonic vehicles.  Improved arc heater electrodes were developed and tested this year which allowed for longer duration, higher enthalpy testing, and more realistic environments for hypersonic TPS testing.  \n  Key flight test technologies were developed for flight termination and flight maneuver optimization.  Hardware-in-the-loop testing and final design of a flight rated, autonomous flight termination system were completed.  An autonomous flight safety system was designed to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle under test if it leaves its designated safety corridor, thereby maximizing safety while reducing flight test costs.  The current phase of this effort was to complete maturation and transition of autonomous flight safety technology to TRL 6 and pave the way for a direct transition to operational use.  Prototype units were being designed and built for use by the Operationally Responsive Space office.  Transition coordination was also underway to include other developmental hypersonic vehicle systems.  Advanced parameter identification maneuvers were developed and programmed into the flight computer of the third X-51 flight.  These optimized test maneuvers were designed to collect far more stability and control data per flight than possible using traditional methods, thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs.\n  Progress was also made in advanced high speed systems test instrumentation.  A flight-weight, laser-based, non-intrusive measurement system was flown on a Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) flight test, resulting in the first-ever in-flight scramjet combustion efficiency measurement.  An advanced system utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum and which significantly lowers gas property measurement uncertainty was transitioned to a DoD ground test center and a DoD research laboratory.  A miniaturized, temperature-compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation testing was constructed.  Design, fabrication and demonstration of non-intrusive laser hygrometer and optical mass flow measurement systems were completed.  Testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge and a high temperature shear stress sensor were also successfully completed. \n  Advances were achieved in the development of a state-of-the-art validated computational fluid dynamics tool.  Improved M&S tools were transitioned to the hypersonic community.  These tools could simulate the complex flows within scramjet engines and include physical modeling for turbulence, fuel-air combustion, and heat transfer.  The code was successfully used to model combustion phenomenon in a scramjet engine.\n  A technology demonstration was performed to evaluate a technique for testing propulsion systems beyond Mach 8 using magnetohydrodynamics to accelerate flow ionized by electron beams."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band while opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  The SET project continued development of a networked data recorder to provide risk reduction in support of the CTEIP iNET development.  The research and development of advanced data protocols for test data transmission across the iNET network continued.  A networked telemetry transceiver using an advanced waveform was developed and tested as a risk reduction effort for iNET development.  The SET project matured and demonstrated radio network technology to rapidly change operating frequencies in the presence of non-cooperative interference, thus maintaining connectivity with no perceivable impact on telemetry network performance.  Spectrum and network management technology development continued, with a focus on capabilities that allowed for dynamic distribution of spectrum resources among test participants.  Technologies matured by SET provided risk reduction in support of spectrum management which was challenged by spectrum sell-off activities.  Development continued on advanced technologies to increase RF bandwidth efficiency.  A wideband power amplifier capable of efficiently operating with advanced waveforms within the traditional telemetry bands was matured and demonstrated.  The prototype amplifier increased overall efficiency in spectrum utilization.  Research continued to determine the ideal coding scheme for advanced waveforms such as Shaped Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, a more spectrally efficient data transmission scheme for aeronautical telemetry.  Forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability in dynamic test environments were completed and demonstrated.  These forward error correction schemes were adopted by the Range Commanders Council Telemetry Group for inclusion in Inter-Range Instrumentation Group telemetry standards.  \n  The SET project continued the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provided higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain and other factors on telemetry channels.  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments.  Additionally, SET compared the data link performance of legacy RF spectrum allocations to the recently allocated C-Band spectrum.  The results of this investigation were published and transitioned to the DoD test ranges. SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology that would enable flexible scheduling of the T&E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L\/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies would reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles."

Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the EWT project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO), including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle on-board and warfighter wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no use of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter cognitive performance.  \n  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, must not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2012 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for soldier systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban areas and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that enabled networking of GPS-enabled components within the test environment, and then using the network to integrate GPS and other positional information across the connected nodes.  The nodes shared raw observables from GPS and inter-node ranges to locate each network node with high reliability.  Final testing resulted in sub-meter position accuracy in environments that may be encountered in urban operations.  A related technological approach employed a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  System components had integrated and planning was underway for preliminary testing in a realistic environment.  Also, progress was made on a warfighter inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters. This technology employed boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours; system performance and system component requirements were verified.\n  To support testing of high-speed, high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed.  The receiver performed significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  Position solutions were obtained at velocities up to 10 kilometers\/second with time-to-first-fix under 0.5 seconds, which was important for testing air-to-air missile systems launched from under the wing or from a weapons bay, and for range safety.  Requirements were being gathered for future test and evaluation GPS TSPI activities and to guide the architecture for next generation solutions.\n  A holographic optical memory system was designed for on-board test data recording and retrieval, extending the data storage capacity of current state-of-the-art holographic memory up to 16 terabytes.  Laboratory testing had demonstrated that an increased capacity beyond 16 terabytes was possible.  Attachment technology development continued with investigation of new adhesive formulations that employed an electrically releasing foil patch.  This technology allowed attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles, significantly reducing the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  Investigations in this area continued with the aim of producing a stable adhesive formulation with an extended shelf life.  To improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes, algorithms and methodologies were investigated to automate detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) with testing planned at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.  This test technology allowed the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations.  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government laboratories.  These efforts were applicable to T&E of modern war fighting systems; a final report was produced."

Major thrusts for FY 2013 include continuing ongoing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, and advanced data acquisition and transformation that require little power along with the development of advanced power sources for test instrumentation.  Additionally, AIST will pursue test technologies to assess warfighter cognition under various workloads.

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.\n  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

Additional developments produced alternative sensor array designs to measure the temperature profiles on the back surface of a HEL-irradiated target so that inverse heat conduction algorithms could be applied to estimate the temperature on the front (HEL-heated) surface.  In this same HEL T&E area, fabrication began on a hyperspectral sensor technology to remotely measure radiance from an HEL spot on the target.  \n  In the area of HEL effects on target, an adaptive optics system was designed and fabrication of a prototype was started.  The test technology allowed improved remote imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  This test technology was designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at various test facilities.  Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path began development.  This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.\n  A test technology supporting both HPM energy on target and effects on target was transitioned to the testing community within Air Force Research Laboratory.  This technology measured the electric field arriving at eight locations on the target and the temperature rise resulting from those fields.  It was used for testing the Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Munitions Project Joint Concept Technology Demonstration.  Also, a family of HPM sensor technologies demonstrated measurement of energy inside large targets during HPM engagements.  The sensor technologies could be used singly or in combination to non-intrusively measure electric and magnetic field vectors at the same location within a target system.  \n  Early testing of electric field sensors in support of electromagnetic rail gun T&E identified a prime source for indicating rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support C-IED testing, the test technology development to measure soil electrical properties built a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  The brass board had been used in proving the concept to measure the soil electrical properties for portions of the test site within minutes versus days associated with legacy systems.  Results produced measurements similar to those of legacy technologies.  This soil properties measurement technology was transitioned to the testing community. \n  The technology to characterize terahertz beam quality in support of testing the proliferating number of Terahertz sensors and detectors, which were used for force protection and characterizing explosives or biological threats, was transitioned to the test community."

This includes efforts to improve the understanding of HEL reflection hazards so that testing of HEL systems can be done safely without risk to observers and sensors.  In addition, test technologies will focus on the characterization of solid state laser effects on targets in support of weapons systems in development and demonstration by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Test technologies to support the measurement of laser lethality on rockets, artillery, mortars, and unmanned air vehicle targets will remain a key area of investment.  Furthermore, efforts to characterize beam propagation through the atmosphere will center on the maritime environment in support of emerging needs of the Navy.  Investment will be placed in laser safety software and hardware to allow testing at multiple test ranges without affecting aircraft and space-based sensors.  \n  Initiatives to achieve very small, non-intrusive current and voltage sensors to measure HPM effects inside a target will be completed.  These technologies will be transitioned to at least two locations to demonstrate the flexibility of these approaches.  A small, minimally intrusive data acquisition device with a wide bandwidth to match that of the non-intrusive electric and magnetic field sensors will be investigated.\n  A HPM test risk reduction effort will be performed to determine the best approach to construct a more durable pressurized \u2013 radio frequency transmitting dome that does not leak over time for a test capability that emulates wideband threats.

To better support weapon research and design, a method will be sought to determine the time out of action for targets after an HPM attack.  In survivability testing, these sensors will support assessment of susceptibility with different HPM source power levels.

The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.

Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.

The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, resulted in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary\/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially supporting testing of the Long Duration \u2013 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology improved the ability to predict fault conditions and thereby enabled focused test strategies that dramatically improved the efficiency of testing.\n  In the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a test technology was developed to enable automated stress testing of UAS software at the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach was agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided the tester with a perspective of system performance and a currently unavailable prediction of behavior.  Recent stress-testing of a representative ground-based UAS system identified vulnerability issues at the command interface layer of the system.  Additionally, in the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a virtual UAS test bed was designed that used environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injected that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  An initial demonstration of this test technology facilitated efficient testing in an operationally representative environment and allowed for safe operations at \u201cedge of the envelope\u201d performance parameters."

The effort to stress test UAS software will explore technologies to integrate UAS models with software exception databases to allow for sharing of test data across multiple UAS platforms.  The UAS virtual test bed effort will complete its architecture and terrain modeling, develop perceptual boosting algorithms based on vehicle sensors, and integrate all sensor and simulation modules into a complete virtual test bed.
