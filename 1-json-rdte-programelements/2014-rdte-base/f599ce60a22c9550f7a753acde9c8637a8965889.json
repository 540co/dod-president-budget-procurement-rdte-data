An EPS system-level CDR will be held 4QFY2014.    \n\nThe Polar MILSATCOM program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the payloads have successfully completed Critical Design Review and the ground system is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to production."

An EPS system-level CDR will be held 4QFY2014.    \n\nThe Polar MILSATCOM program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the payloads have successfully completed Critical Design Review and the ground system is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to production."
