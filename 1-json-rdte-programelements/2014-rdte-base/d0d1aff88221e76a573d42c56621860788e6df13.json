Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects\/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project\/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR\/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project\/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time."
