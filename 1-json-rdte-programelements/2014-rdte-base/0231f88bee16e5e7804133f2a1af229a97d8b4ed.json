As such, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize those space related capabilities.  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and the Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space\/High Altitude Capabilities.\n\nProject #990 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities need to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities.  Sustains Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center and its associated testbed for both operations and spiral development for 24\/7 Friendly Force Tracking integration into a real-time common operating picture for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force Commanders (JTF) and Coalition partners.  The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight specified tasks to USSTRATCOM.
