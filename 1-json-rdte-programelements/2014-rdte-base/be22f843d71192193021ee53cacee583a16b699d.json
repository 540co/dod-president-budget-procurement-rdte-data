            "val": "This program element funds continuous efforts in the development of modernized tactical and fixed base Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that will enable safety of aircraft landings in both the tactical and strategic ATC domains.  ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international air traffic control and combat identification requirements and mandates.  Funding will be utilized to develop, evaluate and integrate candidate technology mandates.  Funded in this program element is the development of an ATC Tactical Network, the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) Web Based Architecture and Airspace Improvements Initiative, Advanced Surveillance, and Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) modernization.  ATNAVICS provides all weather instrument flight capabilities to include enroute, terminal, radar precision approach and landing services to all Army, Joint, and allied aircraft.  TAIS develops software and required hardware for airspace management web services, to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment.  TAIS also integrates advanced surveillance interfaces to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  \n\nFunded improvements to ATC systems, including TAIS, ATNAVICS, MOTS, and TTCS will align these programs with advanced networking, communications and interoperability goals, and provide compatibility with the Army Aviation aircraft and avionics upgrade programs including military (Global Air Traffic Management) and civil initiatives (Next Gen).  This includes development of an ATC tactical network with individual data interfaces between any two ATC systems.  The ATC Tactical Network is complete when TAIS, MOTS, ATNAVICS, and TTCS are all interconnected and share data and information between one another.  This program element includes funding for development of each interface in a sequential manner with work allocated among four developers.  In a networked battlefield, joint service systems and radars provide operational data to ATC missions assuming a communications infrastructure and data processing capability is embedded in ATC systems.  ATC systems control and maintain information relevant to higher level organizations or other external systems.  Advanced networks and communications allow such information to be transmitted, to include aircraft positional information, weather data, landing surface conditions, airspace density, airspace control orders, restricted airspace, and flight plan data.  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies, these various technologies will be incorporated in the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting technologies which include Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Mode 5 and Mode S.  Initial testing and integration of these systems are foundational to Advanced Surveillance to increase ATC systems availability to detect, manage, and disseminate aircraft information.  ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and advanced surveillance data (Mode 5 and Mode S) to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  TAIS, the Airspace Management System of the Army Mission Command System (AMCS), requires the development and testing of web-based services for Airspace Command and Control (AC2) and ATS, and integration of these new web-based services into a common Army Battle Command hardware, ATS and Airspace Integration Improvement Initiatives (AI3).  This will be accomplished through advanced surveillance interfaces, mission planning interfaces, and providing TAIS dynamic airspace updates to the cockpit.  TAIS efforts also include developing and testing improvements to the air picture including the addition of Blue Force Tracker (BFT) correlation and radar fusion capability.  To facilitate increased maintenance and system support, a remote maintenance capability will be developed for robust maintenance and troubleshooting."
