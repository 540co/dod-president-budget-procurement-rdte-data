The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations.  It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections.  The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program.  The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program provides design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support Advanced Technology Concepts.  The program investigates below deck electromagnetic environmental effects.  It also develops the capability to perform remote spectrum and electromagnetic noise monitoring. The program develops the tools and technologies for innovative and efficient spectrum use, and continues the development of relationships between measured EMI and system performance for selected communications systems.\n\n(e) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: Combat Enabler for Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A) during FY2013 and Operation Enduring Freedom - In Theater (OEF-T) during FY2014.
