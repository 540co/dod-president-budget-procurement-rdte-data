            "val": "Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus (formally GRIFFIN), the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) strategic goals to \u201cWin our Nation\u2019s Wars\u201d and \u201cDeter conflict and promote security\u201d.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  \n\nA planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities;  enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.\n\nThe MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, \u201cnon-mil\u201d platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals."

There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks\/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  \n\n2) Pegasus, (formerly GRIFFIN)\/Improved Connectivity Initiative (ICI), connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning\/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. \n\n3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing \u201csandbox\u201d for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations\u2019 military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.\n\n4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners , enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners."
