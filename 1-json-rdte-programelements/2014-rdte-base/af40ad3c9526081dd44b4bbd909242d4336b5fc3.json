Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.  \n\nThe Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance while striving to deliver new and improved capabilities to the warfighter.  CWP provides seed funding to DoD organizations to conduct cooperative research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) projects with foreign government partners.  It is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program dedicated to initiating cooperative RDT&E projects with allied and partner nations.  CWP seed funding is leveraged against funding from other U.S. government sponsors and foreign partners.  In its twelve-year history, CWP has leveraged $3.1 of other U.S. funding for every $1 it has invested in cooperative projects and $4.4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 investment.  \n\nCWP projects enable Project Teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or prepare for transition to operational forces.  These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with our international partners.  CWP projects support DoD acquisition by helping program offices convert U.S.-only projects into coalition solutions for the U.S. warfighter, influencing coalition interoperability in major programs that will have far-reaching use by U.S. forces, addressing requirements of combined operations early in a program\u2019s development cycle to avert risks to joint\/coalition operations and avoid costs associated with adding requirements later in the acquisition process, enabling U.S. DoD access to leading-edge global technology, and providing significant cost savings to the DoD while maintaining a strong research and development base."
