            "val": "Beginning in FY14, PE 0207455F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN\/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the USAF Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN\/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN\/TPS-75 radar system as the AN\/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN\/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN\/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  \n\n3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the Air Force's contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. 3DELRR will contribute to the Air Force's critically important role in the United States Govenment\/DOD efforts to build partnership capacity via the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) pilot program.  This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Composite Tracking Network (CTN), with real-time data to display air activity.  \n\nFY14 completes the Pre-EMD period of the TD phase, including completion of three competing contracts.  The EMD phase of the 3DELRR Program will begin after a MS-B decision in FY14. Acquisition activities for the EMD phase within the FY14 timeframe include, but are not limited to, a competitive source selection to award a single contract for the EMD Phase with contract options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP), MS-B preparation, MS-B decision, Integrated Baseline Review (IBR), Critical Design Review (CDR), test planning\/preparation and fabrication\/test of system components\/subsystems. A Critical Design Review (CDR) will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure the program has properly matured the system design and is postured for successful development of three Production Representative Units (PRUs). Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. Transition to Budget Activity 05 will occur after Milestone B decision approval to enter EMD Phase."

                            "val": "Beginning in FY14, PE 0207455F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN\/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the USAF Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN\/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN\/TPS-75 radar system as the AN\/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition, as the AN\/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life, it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN\/TPS-59, at the end of its service life, to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  \n\n3DELRR will address system sustainability, transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance, detection, and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and, potentially, Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the Air Force's contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. 3DELRR will contribute to the Air Force's critically important role in the United States Govenment\/DOD efforts to build partnership capacity via the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) pilot program.  This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and, if purchased by the USMC, the Composite Tracking Network (CTN), with real-time data to display air activity.  \n\nFY14 completes the Pre-EMD period of the TD phase, including completion of three competing contracts.  The EMD phase of the 3DELRR Program will begin after a MS-B decision in FY14. Acquisition activities for the EMD phase within the FY14 timeframe include, but are not limited to, a competitive source selection to award a single contract for the EMD Phase with contract options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP), MS-B preparation, MS-B decision, Integrated Baseline Review (IBR), Critical Design Review (CDR), test planning\/preparation and fabrication\/test of system components\/subsystems. A Critical Design Review (CDR) will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure the program has properly matured the system design and is postured for successful development of three Production Representative Units (PRUs). Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. Transition to Budget Activity 05 will occur after Milestone B decision approval to enter EMD Phase."
