Department of Army (DA) and Department of Navy (DoN) will maintain separate and distinct funding streams to support this joint program.  DA will resource to the critical Army requirement set validated for the joint Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for High Speed Intra-theater Surface Connector (HSC)and the Capability Development Document (CDD) for JHSV .
