            "val": "The Defense Technical Information Center\u2019s (DTIC) mission is to provide essential, technical research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) information products in a rapid, accurate and trusted manner to support DoD customers' needs.  DTIC, a DoD field activity, along with its Information Analysis Centers (IACs), is the DoD designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information.\n\nWith a modest funding level, DTIC serves as an efficiency enabler by developing and implementing products and services supporting collaboration and communication within the Department\u2019s Scientific and Technical (S&T) community.  Leaning on mature, low-risk, and commercially available technologies, DTIC delivers secure and effective products to its customers.  In this manner, DTIC\u2019s collaborative products are essential to linking DoD\u2019s dispersed laboratories and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) together.  In today\u2019s fiscal environment, the Department cannot afford to conduct business as usual.  DTIC\u2019s existing and future suite of products provide the potential for enabling DoD customers to develop answers to complex problems--for less money--by providing the opportunity to elimination of unnecessary research efforts and reducing the traditional reliance on conferences, training and travel as a means of connecting with professional colleagues.\n\nBuilding on progress from previous investments, the FY 2014 budget request supports four major thrust areas within DTIC:  1) modernize collaborative tools and innovative applications, 2) enhance the effectiveness of DTIC\u2019s library collection and content, 3) continued restructuring of the Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program, and 4) recast the organization\u2019s workforce.   In this budget program, DTIC resources are focused on the following efforts:\n\n1.  DTIC is committed to accelerating the flow and dissemination of information, delivering professional and organizational networking tools for use within DoD, and between business partners in industry and academia.  Since the 2008 advent of DoDTechipedia, DTIC\u2019s collaborative tools enable rapid customer response to current and emerging threats across the defense enterprise, and help identify solutions to complex technology challenges.  Once fully implemented, these tools will offer users visualization, analysis, and data mining functionality, all in a secure environment.  These evolving DTIC capabilities are essential to the S&T and RDT&E communities, and will play a critical role in finding better, faster, and cheaper solutions.  A number of key tools are highlighted below:    \n\n- A recent venture for DTIC is the DoD Research and Engineering (R&E) Portal (DoDTechSpace), a secure professional networking tool for the DoD enterprise.  The tool offers a navigator through which DTIC\u2019s customers can collaborate, share, find, and post information.  A secure application, it connects the defense research and engineering community, DoD laboratories, warfighters, and other DoD agencies, while providing current and next generation employees and researchers with advanced Web 2.0 tools.  A related tool, DoDTechipedia, one of DoD\u2019s first scientific and technical wikis, was launched by DTIC in 2008.  The tool provides an encyclopedia-like resource of science and technology information for DoD and federal government employees.\n\n- The Defense Innovation Marketplace (or \u201cthe Marketplace\u201d) was launched in 2011 as an online public and non-public\/limited resource for DoD and industry to exchange information.  Creation of this site was a direct result of the Department\u2019s \u201cBetter Buying Power\u201d initiative, which calls for the DoD to deliver better value to the taxpayer and warfighter by improving the way it was doing business.  The Marketplace includes a collaborative tool that accepts industry Independent Research & Development (IR&D) project summaries to improve DoD awareness of current industry efforts and identify technology gaps.  \n\n2.  The transformation of DTIC from a static repository of information to an agile delivery agent of dynamic content; i.e., real-time, user supplied, collaborative information.  This effort seeks to enhance DTIC\u2019s authoritative data.  Recent actions involve improving and expanding both the access and content available on the SIPRNET.  Improving content and the quality of information directly supports better decision-making envisioned in the Department\u2019s Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative.  DTIC is active in working to federate access to Scientific and Technical Information (STI) content from government, industry, and academic sources. \n\n3.  The Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office at DTIC provides core funding, management and oversight of the IACs. The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  At present, the IAC program is undergoing a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to three, in order to reduce customer costs and reflect new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings, to include Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems.  In concert with the Department\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative, new multi-award contracts are being put into place, improving competition, small-business presence, and reducing government costs.  Once complete, the restructured IAC Program will be in an even better position to improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs. \n\n4.  DTIC is in the midst of a multi-year process of transforming its workforce.  The ongoing effort is seeking, through attrition, to shift staff expertise and skill sets from an emphasis on traditional librarian services to one that is more technology-savvy.  Through this new staffing model, the organization is hiring talent to take advantage of available technologies to collect, organize, model, analyze, and share information faster and more cheaply.  Concurrently, DTIC is bolstering program management expertise to optimize business processes and operations.  In this vein, DTIC is actively building an expanding cadre of experts in Information Technology, Information Sciences and Architecture, and Acquisition.\n\nThis Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations, to include four core integrated functions: \n\u2022\tCollaboration\n\u2022\tResearch Support & Library Repository \n\u2022\tWeb Services & Hosting\n\u2022\tInformation Analysis Centers (IACs) \n\nThese functions are addressed in the R-2A sections of this document.\n\nMission funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training, professional development, and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and Human Resource (HR) services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications support; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies, equipment, Hardware\/Software; and support contracts for Information Technology services, Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts. \n\nIn addition, this PE provides funding in support of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, in accordance with Public Law 111-251 (Small Business Reauthorization Act) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act. Within the PE, an annual set-aside contribution totaling approximately $400,000 is provided to the DoD's Commercialization Pilot Program, as directed by the Department's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP)."

In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering community.  DTIC\u2019s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions that national security, export control, and intellectual property rights are safeguarded.\n\nIt is DoD policy to establish and maintain a coordinated and comprehensive program to document the results and outcome of DoD-sponsored and performed research and engineering (R&E) and studies, and to provide access to those efforts in an effective manner, in order to make efficient use of the investment that taxpayers have previously made in research and engineering.  In the 21st Century, supporting the S&T and RDT&E communities requires that DTIC integrate, more than ever, our collections with databases, information links, utilizing the latest information technology, whether in-house or outside of our Department, regardless of the source. DTIC, as the central source for DoD-funded current and completed research, brings efficiencies to the Department as users can gather information from many sources with one search.  DTIC\u2019s customers, from the individual researcher to the acquisition professional, can quickly fuse information into the most complete picture needed in a matter of minutes to hours; not days to months. DTIC accomplishes its mission to provide critical scientific, technical and related program information by performing the activities described in the three core integrated functions below:\n\n- COLLABORATION.  DTIC provides the technology tools to promote collaboration, integration and innovation, in real time, throughout the DoD enterprise and with its partners.  DoD looks to DTIC to forge the linkages connecting diverse communities of interest to the critical research data repository maintained within DTIC.  By sharing knowledge easily and securely, the DoD S&T community (to include the service laboratories, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and industry\/academia) can accelerate innovation in technologies that benefits the warfighter.  To avoid duplication of efforts and increase information sharing, DTIC partners with DoD and other federal government organizations to provide access to information resources and tools.\n\n- RESEARCH SUPPORT AND LIBRARY REPOSITORY.  DTIC provides the STI community the authoritative source of S&T information.  DTIC\u2019s repository contains over 4 Million records, to include Strategic Planning, budget, S&T current work, work-in-progress, and completed work (such as Technical Reports and studies).  R&D investments and the resulting outcomes are also available in the collection.  DTIC is charged by the Department to collect, categorize, and preserve this critical S&T information.  In addition, DTIC ensures the proper protection of the material, based on its dissemination limitations (public, DoD and government only, etc.).  The repository facilitates DoD in reusing research in which it already invested its money--leveraging prior research to maximize the impact of R&D dollars.\n\n- WEB SERVICES AND SITE HOSTING.  DTIC develops customized information solutions and hosts applications that support DoD Components.  At present, DTIC hosts more than 70 public, limited and classified web-based information systems.  The jointly developed applications improve acquisition decision-making, increase collaborative research and development efforts, facilitate business processes, and provide improved support for the warfighter.  This budget request directly supports applications operated by DTIC on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering (ASD(R&E)).  Other DoD components are supported on a cost reimbursable basis; key customers include:  Joint Chief of Staff (JCS), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)), and the Combatant Commands.  Notable web-hosting customers include the Federal Voter Assistance Program (FVAP), providing voter access to U.S. military and civilians around the world; the OSD-Comptroller\u2019s R-2 application, a Department-wide effort to standardize appropriated budget information for submission to Congress; and Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service Program, providing scholarships to colleges and universities in an effort to recruit, develop and retain the next generation of personnel in the science, mathematics and research fields for DoD."

IACs serve as a bridge between the Warfighter and the Acquisition\/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research & Engineering focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. IACs, established under DoD Instruction 3200.14, create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key COCOM operational issues such as cyber security, improvised explosive device (IED) defeat and helicopter survivability. The IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies conducted. In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing Scientific and Technical Information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges.  Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting\/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense Research & Engineering community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence. This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&E community at large."
