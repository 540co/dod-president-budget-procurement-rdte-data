The HMS products will be multifunctional, multiband, multimode, network capable, capable of providing communications through a range of low probability of intercept, low probability of detection and anti-jam waveforms. HMS products will provide transformational communication capabilities for the warfighter. HMS is intended to support communications readiness and mission success, in the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) operating frequency range, by providing military commanders with the ability to command, control and communicate with their forces via secure voice\/video\/data media forms. HMS products are hardware-configurable and software-programmable radio systems that provide increased interoperability, flexibility and adaptability to support varied mission requirements. \n\nHMS provides the capability to meet Joint Ground Mounted, Dismounted & Embedded Radio Requirements. Increment 1, Phase 1 developed Small-Form-Fit (SFF) SFF-A, SFF-D and AN\/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio running Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) for use in a sensitive but unclassified environment (Type 2). Increment 1, Phase 2 will develop the 2 Channel Manpack and SFF-B. Phase 2 radios are all Type 1 compliant for use in a classified environment running Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms.\n\nThe FY 2014 budget will provide funding to complete Government Developmental Test (GDT) and development efforts for Manpack; Allow for Information Assurance certification for Phase 2 radios with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability; Perform GDT, including the participation in the Navy MUOS End to End Demonstration, and Multiservice Operational Test & Evaluation (MOTE) with MUOS waveform on the Manpack; Perform Operational Test for Phase 2; Provide technical and engineering support for development efforts including preparing for Full Rate Production (FRP) for Phase 2."
