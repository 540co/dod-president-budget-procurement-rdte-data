Currently it is estimated the Mk21 Fuze will be 72% common with the Navy Mk5 Fuze.  Mk21 and Mk12A fuzes will be similar to the US Navy D5 fuze, but W78\/88-1 LEP and W87 warhead requirements dictate some unique differences.  The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will also develop associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, support equipment, data, flight test hardware, and training.  It will also conduct required system testing (including ground and flight tests) and fielding efforts.\n\nAs a cooperative USAF, USN and NNSA weapon sustainment acquisition, the USAF will implement joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Activities.  The ICBM Fuze Modernization will be tailored to use joint DoD-DOE phase 6.X processes for routine nuclear stockpile activities to align with USN and NNSA operations.\n\nThe production phase MPAF funding is budgeted under M30MLG, Minuteman III Modifications, starting in FY18.\n\nBA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

The Mk12A fuze must be modified to support the W78\/88-1 LEP warhead incorporating enhanced nuclear surety capabilities required by National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 28.\n\nThe fuze modernization schedule was rebaselined to ensure Mk12A fuze development remains sychronized with the W78\/88-1 LEP warhead first production unit delivery shift from FY21 to FY25. \n \nThe US Air Force will develop Mk21 and Mk12A fuzes in cooperation with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), US Navy and United Kingdom.  ICBM Fuze Modernization will leverage technologies, parts, components and development\/production capabilities resulting from extensive fuze work performed by the US Navy and NNSA. Currently it is estimated the Mk21 Fuze will be 72% common with the Navy Mk5 Fuze.  Mk21 and Mk12A fuzes will be similar to the US Navy D5 fuze, but W78\/88-1 LEP and W87 warhead requirements dictate some unique differences.  The ICBM Fuze Modernization program will also develop associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, support equipment, data, flight test hardware, and training.  It will also conduct required system testing (including ground and flight tests) and fielding efforts.\n\nAs a cooperative USAF, USN and NNSA weapon sustainment acquisition, the USAF will implement joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Activities.  The ICBM Fuze Modernization will be tailored to use joint DoD-DOE phase 6.X processes for routine nuclear stockpile activities to align with USN and NNSA operations.\n\nThe production phase MPAF funding is budgeted under M30MLG, Minuteman III Modifications, starting in FY18.\n\nBA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
