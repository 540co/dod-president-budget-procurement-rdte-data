            "val": "This project concentrates on the overall systems engineering, modeling and simulation, architecture and network requirements development, effectiveness assessment and requirements allocation to component systems of the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) system\/family of systems. It also includes establishment and use of virtual test capabilities for system\/family of systems effectiveness testing\/evaluation for AEA; studies and technology risk mitigation demonstrations for AEA components; and AEA battle management, development planning, and development and maintenance of the Air Force Electronic Warfare Capability Investment Strategy (AFEWCIS) in support of AF EW Vision 2030 EW roadmap (EV 2030) and related MAJCOM Core Function Master Plans (CFMPs). These efforts are crucial in the development of critical offensive and defensive electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and relevant CFMPs, as well as joint Air-Sea Battle operations. The joint AEA capability includes offensive and defensive EA elements of the Navy EA-6B and EA-18G; the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant, MALD-J; the EC-130H Compass Call system; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; potentially an unmanned recoverable stand-in jamming platform and potentially a manned low\/mid frequency, high power component capable of long range stand-off jamming suppression of adversary Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) components and non-IADS targets. Recent technology developments and events have led to an increased focus on developing advanced EA capabilities for use in not only major conflict against traditional IADS targets, but also irregular warfare scenarios against both IADS and non-IADS targets such as communications nodes and networks, computers and computer networks, command and control nodes and links, remote controlled improvised explosive devices, and man portable air defenses. To this end, this project will investigate and analyze alternative non-kinetic means to counter\/suppress these electronic elements of an adversary's capabilities.\n\nThis program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and\/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack."
