For FY 2013 the LL Program will support these missions by conducting research and development in five core science and engineering disciplines and four technical initiatives:\n- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.\n- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal planes, integrated imagers, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.\n- RF Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) sensors and development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies and system concepts.\n- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. \n- Cyber Security, includes developing technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.\n- Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information; and novel and engineered materials that utilize nano-manufacturing techniques to create meta or other materials with unique physical and optical properties not readily found in nature.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:\n- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  \n- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts."

JASON members are primarily fully tenured professors in physics, mathematics, biosciences, and engineering disciplines who hold active Sensitive Compartmented Information-level clearances.  The annual outputs of the JASONs are studies provided across the leadership and program manager levels which inform and often shape programmatic and technical decisions involving millions of dollars.  JASONs were previously funded through university research programs, but their level of technical expertise in systems and development is appropriate for incorporation into Applied Research.\n\nThe technical intelligence program is working to develop a detailed understanding of both the opportunity and threat aspects from military-relevant technology emergence and advancement across a range of scientific, technology and capability areas.  These areas include but are not limited to quantum information sciences, data analytics and data-intensive systems, novel manufacturing, directed energy and other emerging technologies to fight and win in denied and contested environments.  Some details are classified, but the focus is to work collaboratively across the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC) to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability.  This capability is coupled with implementation of technical net assessments and other approaches to develop detailed analyses of the opportunities and threats posed by the technology and relevant counter-capabilities where impact appears most significant.  These efforts will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments."

This program continued 'five eyes' collaboration with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to continue assessments on emerging and disruptive technologies and will leverage the best collection of methodologies for scanning\/discovery, prioritization, and assessment of the military relevance for those emerging technologies.  The program continued the effort of the National Academy of Sciences (under the National Research Council) through the Board of Global Science and Technology to engage globally on targeted areas of science and technology to understand global shifts and their relevance to national security.  The Board sponsored several conferences in countries in reference to technologies of interest, with the initial focus on the large data challenge.  In coordination with the National Intelligence Committee and the Defense Intelligence Community effort to Strengthen Science and Technology Analysis, this program continued a strong partnership with the intelligence community to provide clear feedback on products, improve articulation of S&T requirements, and define higher impact products for future development.  Technical Intelligence continued to update and refine the S&T Intelligence priorities and mechanisms for increasing information flow from the intelligence community."
