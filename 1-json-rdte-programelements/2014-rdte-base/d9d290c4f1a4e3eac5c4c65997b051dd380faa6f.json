Trojan research and development supports Trojan Classic XXI (TCXXI) and next generation (NexGEN) future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for a worldwide, deployable, remotable, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation, TCXXI TROJAN NexGen and TROJAN SWARM will provide soldiers with a real-world, hands-on, live and near-real time SIGINT training environment sustaining, maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure, collaborative architecture. \n\nA key factor for future force success is the ability to collect, process and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. Trojan is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay, secure communications to include voice, data, facsimile, and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. Trojan operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection, processing, analysis and reporting systems. This project engineers, tests and evaluates new digital intelligence collection, processing and dissemination technology using the fielded Trojan systems, prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture, these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end, it is imperative that Trojan keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threats."
