Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training\/readiness, sustains DoD\u2019s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer."
