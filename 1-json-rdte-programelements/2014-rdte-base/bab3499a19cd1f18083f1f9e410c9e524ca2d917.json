The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities."
