The JTN program will modify this waveform, making it compatible and certifiable with DoD security requirements while enabling porting to tactical radio sets. MUOS is currently being ported by 5 vendors on 6 different platforms."

The continuing Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) will remain under a joint budget strategy in the three MILDEPs in new PEs (Army PE 0605030A, the Navy PE 0605030N, and the Air Force PE 0605030F). As part of the joint program budget strategy, each MILDEP budgets for their portion of the total program RDT&E funds. Prior to the President's Budget submission, the budget year funding is consolidated in the new Army PE."
