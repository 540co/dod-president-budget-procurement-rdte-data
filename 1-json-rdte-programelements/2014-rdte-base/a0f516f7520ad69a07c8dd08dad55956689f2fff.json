Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center, Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.\n\nThe GIG Systems Engineering and Support project defines and validates the overall technical strategies for DISA in line with the DoD Strategic Information Technology Plan and Enterprise Architecture, Agency Target Architecture and Transition Plans. These strategies establish the foundation for technology investments, technical developments, and the operations and sustainment of critical net-centric products and services provided by DISA. The DISA Chief Technology Officer conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight. The Technology Management Framework (TMF) is used for the early identification of technology needs. TMF products, in conjunction with information from other authoritative sources will be used to analyze technology challenges, needs and service gaps. Authoritative sources include the DoD CIO Campaign Plan, DISA Technology Watch-List, and Innovation Source Book."

Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD\/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are also considered depending upon the task."

These solutions will be coordinated with the stakeholder\/user to ensure EWSE has the right solution to the right problem."

This is critical to support the Military Services, Combatant Commands, office of the Secretary of Defense\/Joint Staff and other mission partners.\n\nThe CTO maintains the Technology Environment, which provides the infrastructure, tools, processes, and techniques to perform various types of assessments and evaluations. These include informal quick looks, technology demonstrations, proof-of-concept events, and technology piloting events, as well as formally orchestrated operational assessments.  The Technology Environment is capable of supporting a broad range of topics and issues such as EA, wireless and mobile computing, transport technologies, net-centricity compliance, unified capabilities services, Web 2.0, Cloud computing, and social networking."
