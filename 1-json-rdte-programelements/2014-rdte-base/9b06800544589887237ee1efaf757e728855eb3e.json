This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on High Energy Lasers (HEL), Electromagnetic railgun development, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic\/infrared (EO\/IR) sensor technologies.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.\n-Initiate and conduct lethality testing for notional designs of proposed solid state laser designs.

Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance in identified key performance parameters.\n-Initiate and conduct scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent \"safe-arm\" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.)

Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. \n\nThe metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational\/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments\/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational\/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass\/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development\/demonstration program."
