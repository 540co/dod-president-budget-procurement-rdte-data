In compliance with the Expanded Electronic Government, President\u2019s Management Agenda, and the DoD Enterprise Architecture Framework, ESS is the unified offering of security mission systems which facilitate and automate improved national investigative and adjudicative standards, streamline security processes, and increase DoD community collaboration.\n\nThe DSS Mission Information Technology (IT) systems provide service critical to the major DSS mission areas for Industrial Security Oversight and Security Education.  DSS performs this critical function through operation of its production mission systems to include the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD), the DSS Gateway, and the Security Training Education and Professionalization Portal (STEPP).  RDT&E for DSS mission systems primarily includes pre-planned product improvements to the applications, researching and improving assured information sharing, better posturing systems and networks against vulnerabilities, ensuring self-defense of systems and networks, and safeguarding data at all stages which are necessary for the DSS to increase efficiencies by providing web-based systems to manage certification and accreditation activities. These IT systems are as follows:   \n\nOffice of Designated Approving Authority (ODAA) Business Management System (OBMS).  The OBMS will automate the approval and certification process of cleared industry\u2019s classified information processing security plans and operations.  This will increase mission efficiency by providing a web-based system to manage certification and accreditation activities, provide improved reporting capabilities to support DSS and industry with better metrics, improve the accreditation timeliness and accuracy and reduce the number of unaccredited systems by providing automated notifications to DSS and industry.  \n\nOpen Source Corporate Management Information System (OSCMIS).  OSCMIS is a Web-based Federal workforce management, workflow, and administrative software suite with more than 50 applications and tools to manage human resource, training, security, acquisition and related functions. The DSS OSCMIS project will deliver direct improvements to information management and functional business processes to effectively manage the agency's Manpower, Human Resources, Training, Security, and Continuity of Operation Plan (COOP) functions.\n\nIndustrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  ISFD is the main DSS mission system that tracks and executes the National Industrial Security Program for DoD and 24 other Federal Executive Agencies of cleared industrial security facilities.  The ISFD provide users with a nationwide perspective on National Industrial Security Program related facilities, as well as facilities under DSS oversight in the DoD conventional AA&E program. ISFD data also provides source data for the DoD Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) and the Facility Verification Request (FVR) application.\n\nField Operations System (FOS).  The FOS will be the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, FOS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  FOS will provide DSS with a comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  FOS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data for decision-making in the hands of field representatives.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  The system will be developed in an iterative fashion in accordance with the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL).\n\nDD 254.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires that a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides to the contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and the classification guidance that would be necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required for the performance on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation\u2019s classified information is properly safeguarded.\n\nMobile Workforce Applications (MWA).  The global DSS industrial security and oversight mission requires field representatives to audit remote contract facilities and information systems that process classified information. By incorporating mobile technologies into daily operations, the workforce has access to relevant and timely information, critical in ensuring security oversight decision-making.  \n\nNational Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is required for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), directing accelerated use of PKI across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DSS business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Expand use of the IdM Solution across the DSS enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications and evaluate the NCAISS investment to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It will also incorporate any remaining DSS operated application into the DSS NCAISS solution."

National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS).  Accomplished migration from the IdM to its replacement since Oracle will no longer support the Sun IdM product in 2014. This will be a major upgrade to the IdM program. Once existing applications are interfaced with NCAISS and are transitioned; work on incorporating other DSS\u2019s applications to the new platform will continue and be completed in FY2014."
