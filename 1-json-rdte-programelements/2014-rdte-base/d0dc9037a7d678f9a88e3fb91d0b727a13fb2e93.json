            "val": "The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system collects, digitally processes, and disseminates real-time target cuing and tracking information; the common tactical 3-dimentional air picture; and command, control, and intelligence information to all Air and Missile Defense (AMD) weapon systems (Avenger and Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS)), and joint and combined arms systems. The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners, airspace battle management, and up-linking of mission operations, thereby enhancing force protection against air and missile attack.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The FAAD C2 system provides this mission capability by integrating dynamic FAAD C2 engagement operations software with the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT), Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS), Sentinel radar, and the Mission Command architecture.  In addition, FAAD C2 provides interoperability with Joint C2 systems and horizontal integration with PATRIOT and Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS) by fusing sensor data to create a scalable and filterable Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) and common tactical picture.  The system software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Division Headquarters as part of the Army's modularity concept.  System software is able to provide target data and engagement commands\/status to AMD Battalions. FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program. Soldiers from activated Army National Guard AMD battalions operate the FAAD C2 systems in the National Capital Region and other locations.\n\nThe Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of AMD operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and ADAM Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The fielding of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Modularity requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions and AMD Composite Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimentional air picture; (2) Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control the airspace. \n\nCounter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the indirect fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop, procure, field, and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; provide localized  warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) systems, warning systems, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation, providing correlated air and ground pictures, linking units to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network, and using various forms of communications to provide situ"

AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the Air & Missile Defense (AMD) Battalions.  AMDPCS has three major components:  (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimensional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations.  AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense.  AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces IAW Annex C to a Joint US\/NATO Air Defense Agreement; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for Air and Missile Defense forces; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control the airspace.  \n \nFY14 funds the development, software engineering, testing and certification of the AMDWS, ADSI, and sheltered subsystem software as described below."

                            "val": "Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the indirect fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop, procure, field, and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; provide localized  warning to the defended area, with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) systems, warning systems, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation, providing correlated air and ground pictures, linking units to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network, and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information in order to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.\n\nThe deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs, theater priorities, and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  The C-RAM Sense and Warn (S&W) capability is currently deployed to locations in Iraq in support of Department of State (DoS) and Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I) operations and in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  In response to a theater requirement tasked to the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), C-RAM installed Mass Notification Systems (MNS) at multiple OEF sites to support base-wide alerts and announcements.  Continuing C-RAM SoS improvement efforts, required to meet emerging theater requirements,  include C2 software upgrades as well as integration and deployment of Ka and Ku band Multi-Function Radio Frequency System (MFRFS) radars for an enhanced detection capability against stressing threats.  Base RDTE funding for FY 2015 and beyond supports maintenance of C2 basic Air Defense functionality.  Support of the existing C-RAM SoS capability deployed in theater has been through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) process.  \n\nNear-term directed enhancements to the C-RAM SoS capability include use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems; integration of Warn functionality into the C2 workstation to reduce complexity and footprint; integration with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) for enhanced situational awareness, combat identification, and response options; and dynamic clearance of unplanned fires (DCUF) in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) for rapid and enhanced response.  \n\nThe C-RAM Program Directorate is also the Materiel Developer for the Accelerated Improved Intercept Initiative (AI3), a rapid development effort to provide an Intercept capability to defeat stressing threats.  Current C-RAM Intercept assets (i.e., LPWS) are undergoing reset and will be fielded to composite Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)\/Avenger battalions beginning in 1QFY14.\n\nThe Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) Warn program evolved from the C-RAM program and is a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM warning equipment, to provide early, localized warning to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).  Prior year C-RAM RDTE funding was shared to conduct RAM Warn test activities in support of the Milestone C decision."

The objective of the strategy is to balance needs, available technology, and resources to quickly provide a robust capability to engage rockets, artillery, and mortars.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) for the LPWS is currently in Department of the Army 3-star staffing.  Upon approval of the CPD, LPWS will transition to fielding and sustainment to Army units.\n\nIn parallel, the C-RAM Program Directorate is developing an enhanced interceptor, the AI3, which was initiated in response to a U.S. Forces-Iraq (USF-I) Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) to counter slow moving, close-in, and irregular flight pattern rockets and munitions.  On 6 March 2012, the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, approved a Directed Requirement (DR) for AI3, which validated the need to continue development of the AI3 capability to achieve a relatively near-term improved C-RAM intercept capability and provide a risk mitigation course of action to support defeat of the threat contained in the JUON.  The approach selected for acquisition of the AI3 is to take full advantage of NDI and COTS items.  The use of COTS and NDI allows the Government to realize the maximum advantage of continually evolving technologies."
