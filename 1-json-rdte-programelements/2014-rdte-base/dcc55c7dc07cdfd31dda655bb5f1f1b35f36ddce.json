This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self defense.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This activity directly supports the Naval Aviation Enterprise Science and Technology Objectives and the Naval Science and Technology Strategic Plan, principally in the Autonomy and Unmanned Systems, Platform Design and Survivability, Power and Energy and Total Ownership Cost Focus Areas, Sea-Based Aviation was designated as a National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) in FY 2011 and will refocus investments beginning in FY 2014 in areas that are Naval unique or dominated by Naval requirements. \n\nFY 2013 funding increase due to two programs that began in FY12 and are ramping up in FY 2013: Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) and Autonomous Aerial Cargo\/Utility System (AACUS). VCAT will identify and mature critical, relevant variable\/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based TACAIR\/ISR systems. AACUS will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The SBA NNR Structures and Materials program is also ramping up in FY 2013. This program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance\/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability\/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue\/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools.  \n\nBeginning in FY 2014, applied research efforts will begin under the Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Propulsion thrust area as well, resulting in the funding increase in FY 2014.  These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N."

Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors\/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information. \n\nAnother goal of this activity is to develop a torpedo defense capability to fill Sea Shield Warfighting Capability Gap\/Enabling Capability: Platform Defense against Undersea Threats, including Four Torpedo Salvo Defense.  This provides a capability to prevent any of the torpedoes, in up to four-torpedo salvos fired at high value units, from hitting those units.  \n\nThis activity supports the Fleet and Force Protection FNC and includes support to Sea Shield and Sea Strike Pillars and FNC Enabling Capabilities for: Aircraft Integrated Self-protection Suite; Fortified Position Security; Advanced Electronic Sensor Systems for Missile Defense; and Shipboard Force Protection in Port and Restricted Waters - Detection and Classification.  \n\nThis activity supports the development of technologies that aid the helicopter pilot when operating in degraded visual cue environments (brown-out).  \n\nFY 2013 funding decrease is due to completion of the STK-FY09-07 FNC for Helicopter Low-Level Operations (HELO).  The decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to new FNC R2 activities titled Sea Strike and Sea Shield.  Efforts in these R2 activities have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 into new R2 activities to support all FNC program EC Investments."

Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies to improve warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems; reducing the time & cost to certify alternative fuels, and mitigate adverse alternative fuel impacts on Naval platforms and equipment; developing sustainable biomass models to support alternative fuel availability to Naval forces; utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design & operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers. Efforts for ONR Science Advisors are also funded in this R-2 Activity.

Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&T Strategic Plan technology focus areas that engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with in-house funding for: applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel; and encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  Efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers Commanding Officers and Technical Directors each fiscal year through rigorous internal competition.  Efforts typically last two to three years, are generally designed to promote the investment in high-risk high-payoff research, and allow young S&Es to manage a Navy relevant research project.  A limited number of successful efforts developed under the basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter.\n \nThis is a new R2 activity effective 2013, titled:  Naval Research Enterprise (NRE).
