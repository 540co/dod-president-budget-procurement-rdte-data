            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance\/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  Three of these objectives are to deter the use of WMD, reduce the present threat, and to prepare for the future threat.  A focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to achieving these objectives and is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up its combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n\nActivities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support strengthening nonproliferation, through the development of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) and development of Arms Control inspection training and operational capabilities.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental CWMD research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund development and operation of the STRATCOM-DTRA SCC-WMD Technical Reachback center, which supports all GCC, US and Allied Forces, and civil authorities with 24\/7 analysis support, enabling force and civilian population protection against WMD attack.\n\nThe DTRA\u2019s WMD Defeat Technologies program element also supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities. The strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion), and 4) Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capabilities to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   There are two of the four focus areas (3 and 4) supported in this program element under projects RA-Information Science and Applications, RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RR-Test Infrastructure.  Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits.\n\nProject RA (Information Science and Application) develops innovative technologies and modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities and provides Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the U.S. and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete CWMD mission space.\n\nProject RE (Counter-Terrorism Technologies) provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Device Defeat; counter-WMD technologies for warfighters; the USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP); and oversight of counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM for warfighter-unique CP technologies.  \n\nProject RF (Detection and Forensics Technologies) develops technologies, systems and procedures for post detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, materials, or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG (Defeat Technologies) develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI (Nuclear Survivability) provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL (Nuclear & Radiological Effects) develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  \n\nProject RM (WMD Counterforce Technologies) provides (1) full-scale testing of counter WMD weapon effects, sensor performance, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) weapon effects modeling, and (3) the DTRA Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR (Test Infrastructure) provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the DoD, the Services, the Combatant Commanders and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets. \n\nProject RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) provides (1) strategic studies to support DoD, (2) decision support tools and analysis to support combating WMD research and development investments, and (3) early applied research for technology development."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  It also conducts the development, validation and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the U.S. commitment under arms control treaties.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts research and development to investigate, identify, develop and transition short term, high payoff technologies from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), other government agencies, industry, academia and international Science and Technology partners into the respective DTRA and other research and development programs and to end user organizations.  The technical reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This project also provides support to international Counter-WMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts.\n\nProgram RA supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  DTRA\u2019s integration of the Chemical-Biological Simulation Suite into the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) Tactical Training System (CTTS) toolset to represent the threat delivery, hazard environment, and real-time sensors will be utilized for training and passive defense within the battlespace.  Particularly in support of Leveraging Science, DTRA continues comprehensive information exchanges with Chief of Science and Technology (S&T) Offices across various agencies responsible for countering biological threats in response to SecDef S&T Priorities Memorandum.   This program also targets development of a common picture of biological threats, clarification of lead on specific counter bio mission areas, and collaboration on common technology development.  \n\t\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominantly due to reduced investment in systems engineering collaboration with external partners and customers and the slowing development and fielding of innovative technologies to the warfighter.  The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in research and development analysis support to fund increased investment in RU-Fundamental Research for Combatting WMD and RG-Defeat Technologies."

This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) operational capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on-site and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring and confidence-building requirements.\n\nThe Detection and Forensics Technologies project under Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation Prevention and Defeat emphasizes the advanced technology development and engineering portion of the overall effort.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the redirection of the nuclear detection portfolio toward a more holistic Nuclear Threat Detection portfolio that integrates both passive and active radiation detection into a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solution. This resulted in a decreased investment in advanced detector technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects in Project RI - Nuclear Survivability and system vulnerability and assessment capabilities in Project RL - Nuclear and Radiological Effects. \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in Detection Technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects research for survivability in Project RL - Nuclear & Radiological Effects."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the COCOM's WMD Defeat CONOPS and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.\n\nThe investment approach is based on a strategic top-down analysis of threat vulnerabilities and aligned with stated organizational core competencies and lines of operations aimed at the defeat of (1) the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) the ability to deliver the same, and (3) the support networks, both physical and non-physical, enabling both.  The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 represents an efficiency reduction to contract support services as part of Departmental efficiency initiatives to reduce reliance on service support contractors.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter-WMD hard target defeat weapons development."

Emphasis is on ionizing radiation effects. The Nuclear Survivability project provides Radiation Hardened (RadHard) Microelectronics and Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation research.  Funding in this project also supports the expanding role of the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program into Science & Technology development for human survivability.\n\nThe NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct research in radiation effects, and validate computational models.  The Nuclear Survivability Experimental Capabilities program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration and the United Kingdom Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new, enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays and neutrons.\n \nThe Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides support for the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group (JAIEG) and the international Weapon Effects Steering Committee (WESC) that was called the NWE Users\u2019 Group.  The WESC establishes standards for U.S. and U.K. nuclear weapons effects simulation codes and models as defined and prioritized by the nuclear community, and serves as a forum for sharing information on nuclear technologies, gaps and plans.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 was predominately due to decreased in investment in nuclear weapons effects relative to a nonrecurring increase for a Short Pulse Gamma (SPG) simulation capability in FY 2012 and decreased investment in human survivability beginning in FY 2013.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in nuclear weapons effects experimental capabilities."

                            "val": "The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project provides applied research to support full and sub-scale testing required to investigate countering WMD weapon effects, and sensor performance, weapon effects modeling algorithm development, and the set-up of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Experimentation Lab (DEL).\n\nThis project provides combatant commanders the prediction capability and the attack options to engage WMD targets, to include related Hard & Deeply Buried Targets (HDBTs) as the proliferation and hardness of this class of targets increases.  The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology (WEP) tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model cratering effects, fragmentation (both primary & secondary), internal air blast, equipment\/container damage, structural response, and penetration.  These efforts will lead to advanced modeling and simulation capability in the countering WMD planning tools, to include the Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) planning tool used for weaponeering and the Vulnerability Assessment and Protection Option (VAPO) planning tools used for force\/structure protection.  The Advanced Energetics & Counter WMD Weapons Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/HDBTs. The Advanced Energetics Program also develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n  \nThe DTRA Experimentation Lab Capability is an Agency-wide capability that assures the timely acquisition, synchronization, correlation and delivery of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) consequence management and mitigation data necessary in combating WMD.  The DTRA Experimentation Lab will be the \u201ckey enabler\u201d allowing the Agency to transform successfully into an interoperable DoD Science and Technology environment.  Using the DTRA Experimentation Lab, DTRA will be able to shape and improve military situational awareness independent of time or location, effectively shorten decision cycles in a CBRNE event, and extend DTRA\u2019s knowledge base externally through collaborative technologies.\n\nProgram RM supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion.  DTRA is developing blast explosives technologies such as the EG Hybridized Enhanced Blast Explosive (HEBX) as well as reactive cases for explosives used for countering special targets including biological weapons. The approach is to develop an enhanced explosive fill that will envelop the target with a high temperature caustic environment that will kill any bio-agents released during the strike.\n\nDTRA initiated efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced material science solutions to support WMD Counterforce missions.  This effort investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic properties.  The goal of this program is to provide a practical mechanism to develop, demonstrate and deliver novel materials for several WMD counterforce missions. Materials developed under this auspice will have use in these areas; Energetic Materials, Non-Kinetic defeat, Agent Defeat (Biological) and Interfacial materials for WMD Sensors\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and planning tools in Project RM \u2013 WMD Counterforce Technologies to properly align mission responsibilities.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in Advanced Energetics and DTRA Wargaming to fund increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThis project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  DTRA conducts an intergovernmental test program with the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) for Biological Agent Defeat testing.  In FY 2014 DTRA will continue research for Biological Re-aerosolization in conjunction with DoD\/DHS\/EPA to help develop precise measurement technologies for residual biological pathogens reentering air after settling\u2014Canceled by DHS.  In addition, DTRA supports the development and demonstration of Transatlantic Collaboration Biological Resiliency Demo (TACBRD), a DoD capability to shape interagency approach to counter a wide area biological event impacting U.S. and partner nations\u2019 key civilian\/military infrastructure.  Particularly in support of capability expansion, DTRA conducts Interagency Biological Restoration Demonstration (IBRD) testing in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reduce the time and resources necessary to recover and restore wide urban areas, military installations, and critical infrastructure, following a biological incident, but is transitioning into TaCBRD.  Additionally, DTRA is funding an internal Research program (Innovative Research Program) which examines the novel use of \u201cMicroNeedles\u201d for use in physiological monitoring and\/or drug delivery; This project is being conducted by Sandia National Labs and the first phase will be completed by February 28, 2013.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to the reallocation of funds from infrastructure development in Project RR - Test Infrastructure to weapons effects and Planning tools in Project RM - Counterforce Technologies, and reduced investment in test infrastructure environment restoration support and the WMD National Test Bed (TB).  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the realignment of test bed facilities from RT-Target Assessment Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities."

It may be possible, however, to achieve target defeat objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires more information and more detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available weapons, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support either physical or functional defeat.  Extending this activity and applying these processes to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target characterization and threat analysis presents the next technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project now consists of three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Support.
