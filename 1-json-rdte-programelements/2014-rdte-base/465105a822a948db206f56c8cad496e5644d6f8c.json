The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.\n\nThis PE\/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services."

The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop, prototype, acquire and integrate Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed, deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs, desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders. \n \nThe REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Teams deployed in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure and deliver solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  \n\nThe REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military\/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:\n- Be responsive to tactical unit commanders engage Brigade Combat Team\/Brigade Commanders (BCT\/BDE CDRs) early and often\n- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement\/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (ONS\/JUONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs\n- In coordination with Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) develop materiel solutions to counter Asymmetric Threats\n- Ensure adequate training and sustainment are provided with every capability\n- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands\n- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army \n- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment\n- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law\n- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units\n \nThe REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top ten priorities based on requirements received from deployed units, and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics, as of 06 February 2013, are:\n\n1. Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat  (46 Requirements\/42 Projects)\n2. Small Combat Outpost (COP)\/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection and Sustainment  (60 Requirements\/52 Projects)\n3. Dismounted Operations Support  (40 Requirements\/34 Projects)\n4. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operating Environments (OEs)  (42 Requirements\/42 Projects)\n5. Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command  (24 Requirements\/16 Projects)\n6. Counter Ambush (Precision against Small Arms Fire (SAF) and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) (4 Requirements\/6 Projects)\n7. Advanced Escalation of Force and Non-Lethal Messaging (10 Requirements\/7 Projects)\n8. Entry Control Point (ECP) Operations and Vehicle Search Operations (10 Requirements\/5 Projects)\n9. Route Clearance Support (8 Requirements\/5 Projects)\n10. Other (61 Requirements\/60 Projects)\n\nTotal:  305 Requirements\/269 Projects\n\n\nThe REF FY14 RDT&E Request of $1.515 million (Base) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat, enhanced Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, Tactical Command, Control and Communication tools. \n\nRDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) item has to be tested."
