Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense and Space\/High Altitude capabilities.  As the Army proponent for space, high altitude and GMD, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities.  As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to review programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities. \n\nProject TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC\/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop and the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation to support of current and future Forces.  \n\nProject TR7 funds the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 - Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I).  It is is a ground-based weapon system that will be designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (RAM). The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support to biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense (IMD) concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.

This is accomplished by participating in and providing support to Unified Quest wargames and experiments to analyze and integrate technology to identify the feasibility integration into Army space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support  biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.  Based on the successful evaluation of Air\/Event Information Sharing Services into NORTHCOM J6 decision support systems we will support the transition of the application to a Joint Capabilities Technical Demonstration (JCTD).  Will support TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We will sustain our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.  BC3 will be upgraded to more realistically address information flows related to Close Air Support."

The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."
