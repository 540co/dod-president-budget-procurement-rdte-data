            "val": "P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal\/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD\/LIC).  The EOD\/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD\/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO\/LIC).  With a decreased budget, CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD) subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department\u2019s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.\n  \nP207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD\u2019s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration\/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility\/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements , and maintains DoD\u2019s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. \n \nP208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain, albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z.\n \nP209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary\u2019s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document, (e.g., 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), \u201cSustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO, in coordination with the ASD (SO\/LIC), is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community."

Developed and expanded a Countering Violent Extremism community of interest, resulting in three new R&D projects that will be initiated in FY13 that represent the mutual\/overlapping research interests of disparate Interagency and DoD partners.  Developed Enhanced Cultural Support Team training which will allow for development of capability and skill sets for female operators to better engage with indigenous populations in support of Village Stability Operations (VSO) and other missions as required. Researched and developed threat group assessments based on open source information that allows operators and decision makers to understand the threats associated within their various areas of operation globally and how these threat groups affect the global security of the US and its allies.  Developed an effort that integrated and fused heterogeneous social media data for use in strategic and tactical operational planning and preparation of the battlefield in support of large international events. This effort provided real time data and analysis capability along with mentorship and training that allowed for end-users to understand and monitor critical events in open source social media.\nInitiated development of frameworks and training to better understand and implement Combatant Command (COCOM) level Communication Activities.  Known as CERTAIN ECHO, this effort delivered Return on Investment Analytic Framework(s) for the COCOM VOICE Programs in order to provide quantifiable measurements of performance, measurements of effectiveness and methods of determining overall return on investment (ROI) of program dollars.
