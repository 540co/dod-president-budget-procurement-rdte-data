            "val": "The RC-135 Operational Systems Development and enhancement activities project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems -both air and ground.  Extensive utilization of commercial-off the-shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through continuous technology refresh cycles and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)\/vanishing vendor items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  \n\nThese activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG, a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO), Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, aircraft sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2014 include support for two distinct RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT configurations [Baselines 11 & 12], two distinct RC-135U COMBAT SENT configurations [Baselines 4 & 5] and two distinct RC-135S COBRA BALL configurations [Baselines 4+ & 5].  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding \"baseline capabilities\" that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental \"baseline\" strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and diminished manufacturing sources\/vanishing vendor items (DMS\/VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nRIVET JOINT Baseline 11 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, precision multi-angle directional finding communications intelligence (DF COMINT) capability, electronic intelligence (ELINT) recorder expansion, precision ELINT digital signals intelligence system (DSS) integration, wideband global satellite communications (WGS) enhanced integration, continued communications, navigation, surveillance\/air traffic management (CNS\/ATM) and required navigational performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing\/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, and new steerable beam antenna.\n\nCOMBAT SENT Baseline 4 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, LN-120 nav system, new radio frequency distribution (RFD), precision ELINT (DSS), airborne parametric measurement system (APMS) upgraded digital backend, aircrew capability extension system (ACES) reachback connectivity, RJ Baseline 9 COMINT, and NCCT integration.  COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and geolocation capability, cooling duct improvements, precision ELINT (CORVUS) super wideband compressive receiver, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, WGS enhanced integration, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).\n\nCOBRA BALL Baseline 4+ upgrades consist of, but not limited to, LN-120 nav system, ACES reachback connectivity, RJ Baseline 9 COMINT, COMINT directional finder (DF), foreign instrumentation signals intelligence(FISINT) intercept coordinator, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and liquid cooling system.  COBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, MIRA sensor\/processor upgrade, MCS optical upgrade, WGS enhanced integration, communications upgrade to include MIDS-J, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.         \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Obsolescence and diminished manufacturing sources\/vanishing vendor items (DMS\/VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nRIVET JOINT Baseline 11 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, precision multi-angle directional finding communications intelligence (DF COMINT) capability, electronic intelligence (ELINT) recorder expansion, precision ELINT digital signals intelligence system (DSS) integration, wideband global satellite communications (WGS) enhanced integration, continued communications, navigation, surveillance\/air traffic management (CNS\/ATM) and required navigational performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing\/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, and new steerable beam antenna.\n\nCOMBAT SENT Baseline 4 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, LN-120 nav system, new radio frequency distribution (RFD), precision ELINT (DSS), airborne parametric measurement system (APMS) upgraded digital backend, aircrew capability extension system (ACES) reachback connectivity, RJ Baseline 9 COMINT, and NCCT integration.  COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and geolocation capability, cooling duct improvements, precision ELINT (CORVUS) super wideband compressive receiver, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, WGS enhanced integration, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).\n\nCOBRA BALL Baseline 4+ upgrades consist of, but not limited to, LN-120 nav system, ACES reachback connectivity, RJ Baseline 9 COMINT, COMINT directional finder (DF), foreign instrumentation signals intelligence(FISINT) intercept coordinator, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and liquid cooling system.  COBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, MIRA sensor\/processor upgrade, MCS optical upgrade, WGS enhanced integration, communications upgrade to include MIDS-J, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.         \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
