Transitioned Tech Recovery self contained breathing apparatus from combined PATRIOT\/ELABS system to a single Self Contained Hybrid Emergency Life Support Device (SHIELD) system reducing operator weight by more than 13 lbs and adding increased oxygen capability and duration.  Continued development and government testing activities for the GA Integrated Oxygen System (GAIOS); two of the three systems officially entered government Developmental Testing and will move to Operational Testing in FY13.  Completed development of software plug-ins, software updates, and integration for inclusion of Medical 9 Line and CSAR 15 line form templates in GAO Kit software for greater battlefield situational awareness and patient care.  In addition, additional training was required to be developed and conducted to support government testing events for the GAO Kit software and equipment.  Continued development efforts and studies for Remote Patient Monitoring and Digital Enhanced Vision Devices as tools for use within the GAO Kit."
