            "val": "This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aeromechanics.  Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques.  Flight control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles.  Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses.  Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned and remotely piloted air and space access vehicles.  Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary aerospace vehicle technologies."
