Individual projects generally span a two to three year period and are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within the project timeline.  During FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRTO continued to expand its maritime and irregular warfare portfolio as a complement to the existing maritime technology demonstrator and ground, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolios and in FY 2014 RRTO will continue these efforts and enhance its focus on developmental rapid prototyping.

The HFDS was demonstrated in various configurations, which resulted in its consideration for transition to the US Army, US Marine Corps and US Navy.  The Forward Operating Base Defense Integrated Protection Initiative deployed a suite of capabilities to two Forward Operating Bases in Afghanistan; the Army is analyzing the results.

The Naval Underwater Threat Interrogation and Covert Assessment Systems (NAUTICAS) is a project to non-invasively identify contraband materials such as explosives or illegal drugs being transported by maritime vessels underway.  In FY 2012, NAUTICAS was selected as the centerpiece of a joint Navy\/Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) effort to detect Home Made Explosives (HME) in maritime domains.  The Inflatable Catamaran (I-Cat) Structural Loads Testing and I-Cat Hull Construction and Design Improvement received the endorsement of the Commander for Naval Special Warfare (NSW), as well as significant contributions from U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Office of Naval Research.  The Inflatable Catamaran projects are intended to demonstrate and test improvements to the Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC).  Concurrently with execution of this project, NSW designated the inflatable catamaran as one of a family of future craft known as Combatant Craft Light (CCL Mk 1), a program of record with an Initial Operating Capability in FY 2016.  The Common Maritime Technology Working Group (CMTWG) was formed in FY 2012 to unify the combatant\/small craft community and developed a crosswalk of science and technology (S&T) needs and requirements based on input from the US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Army, US Coast Guard, and Special Warfare community.   Priorities identified through the CMTWG were used to inform future Capability Demonstrations aboard Stiletto.  Stiletto doubled the number of demonstrations it performed in FY 2012 over the previous year by working more closely with operational commands through exercises like Trident Warrior and Trident Spectre.  Twenty-five separate technologies were demonstrated during Trident Spectre 2012 which was sponsored by the Naval Special Warfare Support Activity-2.  During Trident Warrior 2012 at Fort Eustis, VA, Stiletto served as a \u201ccontrol ship\u201d for multiple unmanned autonomous vessels.  During FY 2012, Stiletto also demonstrated multiple radar systems, remote stabilized weapon systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) capabilities, full motion video, and unmanned system launch and recovery.  In FY 2012, Stiletto revised its business model to create three Capability Demonstrations per year.  Each capability demonstration is guided by an individual lead organization or command and is focused on that organization\u2019s articulated capability needs.  In order to preserve Stiletto\u2019s outreach to non-traditional businesses by providing a low-cost, accessible demonstration venue, Stiletto continued to offer open technology demonstration periods throughout the year."

The goal is to have a successful prototype system that leads to the development of an operationally deployable prototype.  Continuing in FY 2013, the Inflatable Catamaran project will improve the existing design and construction processes for the inflatable hull component of the CCL Mk 1 inflatable catamaran with an initial operating capability in FY 2016. The improved hull form will increase durability, reliability and maintainability.  The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial. The CMTWG will identify the lead organizations for Stiletto Capability Demonstrations and continue to analyze common small craft technology needs in FY 2013.  Potential new Maritime Irregular Warfare projects for FY 2013 include demonstration of the Spike Non-Line of Site (NLOS) system in cooperation with US Navy Director of Expeditionary Warfare and US Naval Air Systems Command; development of the Spar buoy deployable ocean sensor system with the US Navy Director of Expeditionary Warfare and other partners; and an effort to focus on emerging advanced undersea weapons and sensors.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare focus area will continue to support Stiletto\u2019s maritime technology demonstrations.  Emerging capabilities will be demonstrated on Stiletto during three Capability Demonstrations in FY 2013, including participation in Trident Warrior and Trident Spectre, as well as three Technology Demonstration periods throughout the year.

The May 2012 update by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) focused on assessing existing and needed technical capabilities to respond in a systemic, rapid, sustained, and measurable way to adversarial narratives being used to undermine US military and security efforts.  It also identified technologies to rapidly analyze and respond to those narratives in the information environment.  The final report identified gaps in seven areas to guide future project development: analytical tools, production, content delivery, research, planning, training, and evaluation tools.  The new analysis was distributed to stakeholders through DoD, COCOMs, DoS, academia, and private industry.  Four new projects were started in FY 2012 to support Information Operations and CVE needs in partnership with SO\/LIC, the COCOMs, and the DoS\u2019s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC).  NORTHCOM Influence Assessment Capability (NIAC) Education and Training (NET) Research Project One (NETp-1) applied a social science research based approach to develop assessors\u2019 capabilities to tailor socio-political data collection, evaluation, and analysis to a given Theater Campaign Plan objective or effect under study.  CVE Messaging is an effort for the CSCC\u2019s Digital Outreach Team, coordinated in support of SO\/LIC and US Central Command (USCENTCOM) interests, to develop the capability to track and assess the spread and impact of al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) propaganda in mainstream online environments.  Further, it assessed the concurrent spread and impact of counter-messaging campaigns.  This project built on Sandia National Laboratory\u2019s existing capabilities to track and assess the spread and impact of AQ propaganda in mainstream online environments, attributed counter-messaging by the CSCC Digital Outreach Team and assisted in guiding Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) influence and influence assessment efforts.  In FY 2012, some of the technical capabilities from the CVE Messaging project were transitioned to US Pacific Command, which will continue to fund the tools as part of its Information Operations efforts.  In addition, the Information Operations Assessment Foundation project was started with the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center to identify and adapt best practices in influence assessment for the DoD\u2019s IO Assessment Framework.  A new project was also initiated with USCENTCOM and SO\/LIC to develop mobile applications in support of CVE activities."

These prototypes will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capability under realistic conditions and often against current capabilities or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program and Thunderstorm ISR integration exercises.  Knowledge and experience gained through those demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  These initial prototype efforts will help reduce the cost of future acquisition programs and stimulate efforts beyond traditional defense industrial base activities.  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics.  Advanced developmental prototyping provides a mechanism to guard against technological surprise, preserve industrial base capabilities, impose asymmetric strategic costs on potential adversaries, and explore innovative, technology-enabled military capabilities."
