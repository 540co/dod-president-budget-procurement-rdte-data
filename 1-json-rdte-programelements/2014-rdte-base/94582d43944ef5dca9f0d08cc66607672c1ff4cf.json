            "val": "Space-based sensors offer on-demand, geographically independent and persistent coverage of areas of specific concern for ballistic missiles with no need for indications and warning. Space-based sensors also expand the battle space of all BMD ships operating in the northern hemisphere with increased raid size handling and threat range capability. With the two Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellites (launched in 2009), the Agency regularly and consistently demonstrated space-based remote sensor and fire control integration, initially in April 2011 in Flight Test Marine (FTM)-15 and most recently in May 2012, in FTM-16 Event 2A.  These successes are informing the design, integration, and operations of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS). \n\nThe PTSS is a space and ground segment system that will provide persistent sensor coverage of enemy ballistic missiles. The PTSS is designed to be an integrated part of the BMDS: one that receives cues from all acquisition sensors and provides outputs to the BMDS battle manager & missile systems. The program mitigates cost, schedule and performance risk by: 1) simplifying the design by focusing on the BMDS mission, 2) incorporating components and subsystems with high technology readiness levels and on-orbit pedigrees and 3) involving industry and the military services up front & early to inform the design for producibility, operations and sustainment. \n\nThe PTSS has inherent capability for other missions such as Space Situational Awareness. The Agency expects that capability to be exploited by the joint warfighter when the PTSS is not engaged in a missile defense mission. \n\nThe Combatant Commands and Services have a need for a persistent ability to provide fire-control quality tracking of a raid of ballistic missiles over their entire trajectory for both homeland and regional defense scenarios, specifically, improve birth-to-death tracking, identification, and targeting, including the capability to detect, track, discriminate and counter large, dense raids, and structured attacks. Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) systems acquire and track the boost and early post-boost phases of a missile`s trajectory, but the PTSS is required to continue to track ballistic missiles through their accent, apogee, and until they reenter into the earth`s atmosphere. \n\nGoals and objectives for the PTSS are: \n\n\n   - Develop an operational missile tracking capability from space, which will close the BMDS fire control loop, specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems, by way of the BMDS battle manager. \n   - Reduce operational, fire control risk by co-locating the national lab design teams for PTSS and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, and by embedding US Navy and US Air Force operations and sustainment experts in the PTSS hybrid program office. \n   - Focus on tracking raids of regional Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles, Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from today`s regional threats. \n   - Develop and test the development satellite articles and the integrated ground system with the BMDS. \n   - Ensure early industry involvement by awarding contracts to join the Integrated Systems Engineering Team (ISET) during the development satellite article design. Six Industry partners (Ball, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Orbital, and Raytheon) contribute to the national lab development effort to improve the Precision Tracking Space System design for manufacturability and reduce the production risk. \n   - Use data from the on-orbit Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellite testing events \n   - Benchmark models and simulations. \n   - Allocate requirements, interface controls, and evaluate operations concepts. \n   - Leverage experience gained from STSS test events to demonstrate capability and insight into Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance linkages and hand off to the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense fire control system. \n   - Develop a government owned design to foster production competition over the life of the program.\n\nThe Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) contributes to defense of the U.S. homeland and regional, missile defense, including large raid protection. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

                            "val": "This Program Element funds the development of a space-borne sensor constellation and ground system that closes the fire control loop with the BMDS shooters, specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems, by way of the BMDS battle manager. The PTSS also focuses on tracking large raids of regional Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles, Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from today`s regional threats. As threats expand and mature the need for continuously available sensors and faster interceptors supports continued investment in a PTSS development. Lessons learned from the two Space Tracking & Surveillance System demonstration satellites currently on orbit are guiding our decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable, continuously available, operational precision track space sensor constellation and ground system. \n\nThe PTSS provides the effectiveness of a highly available early missile tracking capability from space by developing, launching and operating a pair of development satellite articles using an integrated ground control system in FY 2017. The PTSS development satellite articles will demonstrate early, precise, real-time tracking of ballistic missiles to close the BMDS fire control loop from space. This capability significantly improves BMDS performance by effectively expanding the threat engagement range of all BMD ships operating in the northern hemisphere. \n\nThe PTSS avoids some of the challenges of terrestrial and airborne sensors. \n\n\n   - Provides reliable and constantly available ballistic missile tracking capability in the areas of the world of most concern. \n   - Eliminates the need for host nation agreements. \n   - Does not require transport to theater or limit our operational flexibility. \n   - Mitigates the impacts of weather effects (clouds, crosswinds and icing for airborne, and rain for radar). \n   - Deals with threats arising from unexpected locations or adversaries. \n   - Greatly lowers operation and maintenance costs. \n   - Observes and tracks launches beyond the range of airborne and terrestrial sensors.\n\n\nPTSS supports essential BMDS functions by: \n\n\n   - Continuously observing the U.S. Homeland regional and rogue ballistic missile threat in post-boost. \n   - Sending fire-control quality tracks to the BMDS shooters, specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems, by way of the BMDS battle manager. \n   - Tracking large raids of nearly simultaneously launched missiles. \n   - Providing radiometric data supporting challenging post-boost detection requirements, object classification, and hit\/kill assessments. \n   - Adding infrared-based tracking to the existing radio frequency sensors in the architecture for dual phenomenology. \n   - Providing coverage of the geographic regions and latitudes of concern. \n   - Contributing modeling and simulation (M&S) emulation models to the BMDS-level M&S environment. The Precision Tracking Space System models, when added to M&S products from other BMDS elements and advanced technology projects, will facilitate trade studies and analyses for Standard Missile-3 Block IIB development.\n\n\nThe PTSS team capitalizes on expertise from external organizations to aid the design process: \n\n\n   - US Air Force. The USAF, as lead service for the PTSS, provides operations and sustainment strategies and concepts to ensure the ground and space segments can be easily transferred to a service. The USAF has embedded its personnel in the PTSS hybrid program office to facilitate this function. \n   - US Navy. The USN, as operator of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense weapon system, is providing assured communications and weapon system expertise so that the PTSS can effectively close the fire control loop from space. To the same end, the USN will embed its personnel in the PTSS hybrid program office. \n   - Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU\/APL). As both the lead performer on the PTSS and design expert for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense weapon system, JHU\/APL shortens the communications chain by leveraging the co-location of its two design teams. JHU\/APL allows the government to manage BMDS interface changes effectively throughout the development articles and maintain intellectual property within the government for future competition."
