The focus is on sensor components, sub-components and software algorithms to improve detection of mines, explosive threats and directed energy; ballistic methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce reconnaissance capabilities of the enemies.  This PE also supports DoD's Center of Excellence for Unexploded Ordnance which coordinates and standardizes land mine signature models; maintains a catalogue of mine signatures; supports the evaluation of mine detection sensors and algorithms; and working in conjunction with the US Army Engineering, Research and Development Center (ERDC), examines countermine phenomenology of surface and buried mines, and explosive threats.  Project H24 advances state of the art Countermine technologies to accurately detect threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo.  Project H35 evaluates and develops advanced signature management and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions.  \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Fort Belvoir, VA."
