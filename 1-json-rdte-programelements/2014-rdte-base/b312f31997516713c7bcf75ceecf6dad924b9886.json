            "val": "This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it focuses on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control.  This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location.  Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics.  Creating a \"pharmacy on demand\" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them.  Another effort will develop assessment tools to identify soldiers in real time who represent depression and suicide risk by identifying speech biomarkers.  This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations)."

The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.\n\nApplied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.  The basic research part of this program is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01."

The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and be transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.   Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power\/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution\/energy storage.  The final suit is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform their missions with reduced risk for injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance and the long-term health of our veterans.

The program will follow high-risk populations of service members to elucidate injury from both isolated and repeated events.  Service members in the program are tested with a combination of imaging and neurocognitive functional exams prior to training, after training workup-but before deployment, and again after deployment.  During training and deployed operations the service members wear blast dosimetry systems to document any exposures.  All exposures are analyzed through detailed 3-dimensional reconstructions, combined with medical evaluations and testing records to determine the complex relationships between mechanical properties of blasts and the initiation of pathophysiologic responses.  This effort builds on the successful deployment of the Blast Gauge measurement system in association with clinical indices of neurologic and psychiatric status to define a quantifiable relationship between timing and intensity of blast exposures and development and recovery of physiologic and clinic changes in an active duty population exposed to repetitive sub-clinical blast exposures and at an increased risk of involvement in clinically significant blast events."
