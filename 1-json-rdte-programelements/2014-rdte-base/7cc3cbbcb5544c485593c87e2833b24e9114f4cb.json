These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.\n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program. Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector. The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."

These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level(TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology. \n\nPhase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier Department of Defense (DoD) SBIR program.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and\/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community. One important strength of the SBIR program is that once a company has received a Phase I award the follow-on Phase II and III awards can be awarded in a non competitive process since the competitive process took place under phase I."
