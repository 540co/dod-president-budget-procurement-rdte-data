The THAAD element includes five major components: Interceptors, Launchers, Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance - Type 2 (AN\/TPY-2) Radars, THAAD Fire Control and Communication (TFCC), and THAAD Peculiar Support Equipment. THAAD delivered Battery #1 in FY 2009 and Battery #2 in FY 2010 to the U.S. Army at Fort Bliss, Texas for initial fielding and training. THAAD has completed the development of the THAAD 1.0 configuration and is developing the THAAD Build 2.0 capability. Continued development and integration will provide for enhanced debris mitigation, improved interoperability with other Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) elements, and development of training devices to support the THAAD Institutional Training Base. \n\nCyber Operations sustains Missile Defense Agency (MDA) DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities, analysis of validation results, risk assessments and reviews of proposed Program Manager\/Information Assurance Manager (PM\/IAM) Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for MDA Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) mission systems and supports THAAD certification to operate in the BMD System.\n\nTHAAD System Test conducts Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Flight Tests and Ground Tests with other BMDS elements (including BMDS Command Control \/ Battle Management and Communication, PATRIOT and Aegis) in accordance with BMDS Integrated Master Test Plan. THAAD System Test coordinates with Operational Test Agencies, conducts flight test operations, performs post-flight test reporting, and performs data distribution and data storage at Pacific Missile Range Facility and the Reagan Test Site. \n\nPATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) is a U.S. Army short range BMDS that interfaces with the BMDS. MDA funds PATRIOT participation in BMDS interoperability integration efforts. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

This capability includes engagements against short to medium-range ballistic missiles and asymmetric threats. Development of THAAD`s next incremental capability (2.0) will enhance and extend the current 1.0 capability and be delivered as part of THAAD`s acquisition\/development strategy.\n\nTHAAD 1.0 (Baseline Capability Development) provided the fundamental capability against short and medium-range Ballistic Missiles and asymmetric threats inside and outside the atmosphere by FY 2012. This development completed with: 1) Ground and Flight Test of the weapon system against complex Re-entry Vehicles (RV), background clutter, and Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) threats; 2) Ground and Flight Test of the initial Discrimination Capability; 3) Enhanced communication capability to support Link 16 compatibility with the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and engagement coordination with other BMDS elements; and 4) Conditional Materiel Release.\n\nTHAAD 2.0 (Advanced Capability Development) expands the capability of THAAD 1.0 system. New THAAD capabilities include: 1) Launch on Link 16 BMD System Based Track providing the ability to initiate an engagement and launch THAAD interceptors using sensor data provided by BMDS sources outside the THAAD Battery; 2) Improving THAAD Weapons System performance in the presence of a high debris environment; 3) Expanding the defended area footprints by remote operation of THAAD Launchers; 4) Peer-to-peer engagement coordination with Aegis and PATRIOT weapon systems; 5) Software upgrades to maintain capability against evolving threats; 6) Message based regional engagement command functionality to process message content from Command and Control\/Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to obtain direction for target engagement; 7) Weapon System Information Assurance mandatory updates; 8) Warfighter requested enhancements; and 9) Upgrades to maintain interface with other BMDS software builds.\n\nIn addition to THAAD Development, there are three planned tasks: THAAD Program Support, Program Operations, and Project Redwood.\n\nTHAAD Program Support (previously Maintenance, Training, and Transportation) provides institutional and unit training devices to support U.S. Army requirements based on the System Training Plan (STRAP) and provides maintenance and transportation to support THAAD development. \n\nProgram Operations (previously Program Management) provides strategic planning, program integration, cost estimating, contracting, financial management, internal reviews and audits, earned-value management and program assessments for the THAAD Program Office.\n\nProject Redwood- Details at a Higher Classification is reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1) in the Special Access Program Annual Report to Congress."

In addition, includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation. Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations, such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses. Also includes legal settlements. In keeping with congressional intent, Program Wide Support is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total MDA budget."
