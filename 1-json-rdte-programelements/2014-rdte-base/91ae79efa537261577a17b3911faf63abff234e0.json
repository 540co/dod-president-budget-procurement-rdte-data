            "val": "FY 2014 budget request funds Electronic Warfare Development.  This program element (PE) encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical electronic warfare (EW).  EW encompasses the development of tactical EW equipment and systems mounted in both ground and air vehicles.  The systems under this program provides the Army with the capability to degrade or deny hostile forces the effective use of their communications, countermortar\/counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, infrared\/optical battlefield surveillance systems and electronically fused munitions.  Existing Army EW systems must be replaced or upgraded to maintain their capability in the face of threats. Prophet Enhanced (PE) is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program. Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces. PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) Project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon systems."

                            "val": "The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) is a Department of the Army established program to develop techniques, methods, tools and architecture to reprogram mission software embedded in Army Electronic Warfare (EW) systems, Force Protection Systems (FPS), and Target Sensing Systems (TSS) in response to changes in threat signatures.  The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in AR 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. Current military operations are conducted in a rapidly changing threat environment, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Infra Red (IR) man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) seekers, radar guided surface-to-air-missiles (SAM), laser guided weapons, anti-helicopter mines, and targeting sensors are proliferating and evolving. Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated EW threats, and the ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid-reprogramming of mission software and information dissemination for Army supported, Joint, allied service, EW integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). The ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. CREW) survivability systems including those deployed in the CENTCOM area of responsibility (AOR). ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect EW, FPS and TSS; determines the impact of observed signature changes; creates new mission data software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software changes; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected EW, FPS and TSS.  Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level - maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army EW, FPS and TSS, and supports Service and JCS Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters.  ARAT Research and Development enables continuous development of:  1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Aviation Mission Data Sets (MDS) and Ground loadsets , 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MDSs and loadsets, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field."
