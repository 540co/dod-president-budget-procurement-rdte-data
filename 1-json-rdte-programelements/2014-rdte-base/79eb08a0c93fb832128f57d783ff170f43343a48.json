Studies and analysis will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, and are essential for managing and responding to the ever-changing complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  The need for independent analysis has become particularly acute with the evolution of requirements for planning the reconstitution of forces affected by operations, and there is a strong need to incorporate the effects of operational analysis in force planning assessments. With the persistently complex security, threat, and economic environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.\n\nIn FY 2014 the budget request for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems (TSCMIS) program will be transferred to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  TSCMIS is an existing program that will be executed by the Joint Staff separately from the Technical Studies, Support, and Analysis program. The Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information Systems program responds to OSD's Guidance for Employment of the Force so that Combatant Commanders, Military Department Chiefs, CSA Directors, and applicable Defense Agency and Field Activity Directors are able to use a tracking mechanism to account for their steady-state activities that is accessible to other DoD components. Together these tracking mechanisms will provide a global view of all steady-state activities conducted by DoD components. The intent of this program is to encourage further development of tracking mechanisms in order to achieve full visibility of Defense Department activities."

The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Security Strategy of the United States of America.\n\nIn following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope and detail of studies and analyses will be abridged in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements from legislative direction."
