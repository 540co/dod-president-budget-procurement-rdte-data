For FY12 and prior years, funding for JNWC resided in PE0101313F as RDT&E Funds. In the FY13 POM, JNWC requested ~70% of their $9.6M funding be recolored to reflect increased O&M role and 30% remain as RDT&E. Funds to remain as RDT&E were incorrectly zeroed out by AF Panel under assumption that COCOM didn?t need RDT&E funding.
