            "val": "Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  \n\nSmall Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/GMTI) is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors. \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infra Red \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   \n\nProject 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor, currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system.  The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed common Ground system - Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.\n\nProject 123:   The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

A follow-on production and sustainment contract is planned for award in August 2013 for 3 years that will procure all the remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform and provide system sustainment.  FRP is scheduled for FY13 while S\/W improvements to the current sensors are planned for FY14.\n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) EO\/IR\/LD is a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army.  It was briefed and approved at the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) in Dec 2006.  A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. FRP is scheduled for FY13 while improvements to the current sensors are planned for FY14.  CSP High Definition (HD) is being cut into the existing payload with a retrofit schedule planned for award in FY13 to bring all of the previously procured CSP baseline systems up to the HD configuration.   \n\nThe acquisition strategy for FY14 software development to improve CSP and STARLite Sensor Processing and Exploitation is to utilize existing contract vehicles."

The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).\n\nThe TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes, passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.\n\nFY2014 Base funding in the amount of $24.691 Million supports TSP Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase contract as well as test and evaluation, program management and engineering costs."

The TSP program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition and was focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform and integration and test of TSP software into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A). The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that are currently fielded on the Hunter UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program.\n\nThe TSP programs Acquisition Strategy has been modified to accommodate the FY 2012 Appropriation that reduced the 11B Funding Line by $14.100 Million. The TSP program is following an incremental Acquisition Strategy with a TSP Block 0, Block 1 and Block 2. Schedule adjusted in accordance with the TSP Acquistion Decision Memorandum dated 22 Mar 2012.  \n\nThe TSP Block 0 will provide an early TSP operational capability for the Gray Eagle program. \n\nThe TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record that entered EMD in FY 2011.  \n\nThe TSP Block 2 effort will address System enhancements and upgrades as the threat and technology evolves."

The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.
