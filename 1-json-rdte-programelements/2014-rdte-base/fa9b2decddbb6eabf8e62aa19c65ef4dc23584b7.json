            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy.  CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as train tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in current combat operations in Afghanistan, and their transition to Unified Land Operations.\n\nFY 2014 Project 571 core funding of $.828 million for CCTT enables the P3I for the CCTT DSTS in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, Airborne, Ranger, Special Forces units and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams. \n\nFY 2014 Project 577 core funding of $2.118 million for Games for Training will integrate the flagship product into the Live-Virtual-Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE). \n\nFY 2014 Project 582 core funding of $20.860 million for SE Core will provide for common virtual terrain databases to be generated by the Terrain Database Center (TDC).  The TDC continues development and refinement of the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC).\n  \nFY 2014 Project 585 core funding of $3.828 million for AVCATT will develop and test the replacement Sensor Video Recording System functionality in AVCATT to meet the After Action Review (AAR) Key Performance Parameter (KPP).  It will also design new capabilities to enhance training when using the AVCATT and NCM3 in combined mode, including improved communications, hoist operations, slingload operations, and visual realism improvements."

CCTT develops, fields and sustains a networked system of interactive computer driven simulators, emulators, and semi-automated forces that replicate combat vehicles and weapon systems, combat support systems, combat service support systems, and command and control systems to create a fully integrated, real-time collective task training environment for armor, infantry, cavalry, reconnaissance, and other combat units at Squad through Brigade level.  CCTT allows command units and Soldiers to practice Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) that, if performed on real equipment, would be too hazardous, time-consuming and expensive.  These trainers enhance realism and allow Soldiers and units to learn tactical, combat lessons on maneuver, command and control, convoy operations, and improved teamwork for increased survivability and mission effectiveness.  The P3I enhances CCTT's capabilities as a tactical trainer and maintains concurrency with fielded, tactical equipment and force structure.  These improvements will maintain interoperability with the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT), Army Battle Command System (ABCS), including Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2), Live, Virtual and Constructive-Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) and other simulation systems needed to execute training for current and future combat operations. \n\nFY 2014 core funding of $.828 million for CCTT enables the P3I for the CCTT Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, Airborne, Ranger, Special Forces units and Armor Brigade Combat Teams."

SE Core's mission is to ensure the Army's virtual training systems and simulators are integrated and interoperable. SE Core provides virtual simulators with visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Unified Land Operations.  The result is a \"Fair Fight\" capability; no simulator or operator will have an inherent advantage over another.  Fair Fight allows for air and ground to have coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations.  Additionally, SE Core is building the Army's Common Virtual Environment (CVE) that provides the linkage between simulators and establishes a common environment for interoperability, allowing various simulators to be \"hooked up\" together for a train as we fight capability. SE Core is a foundational element in the Army's Training Transformation Plan linking the embedded systems, multi-mode Live, Virtual, Constructive, Gaming (LVCG) training capability with current systems.\n\nThe SE Core components are One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) integration; terrain database production; common visual models; a virtual systems architecture; a dynamic environment; mission command development; and net ready.  A major SE Core component is the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) process used to produce the synthetic terrain used in simulators and simulations.  This terrain produced by SE Core is a key component for virtual simulators and constructive simulations and will expand to meet the growing demands of today's and future simulations.  \n\nFY 2014 base funding of $20.860 million will continue the efforts of providing expanded development and production for common terrain databases.  FY 2014 funds will modify the Terrain Development process for constructive Terrain Database Production and continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture.  Maintaining OneSAF for virtual simulations enables interoperability with the LVC ITE and reduces cost as individual virtual simulators will no longer develop and maintain separate SAFs.  The SE Core Product Line of Common Virtual Components will continue with upgrades, integration and refinement, and the continued development of common visual models."

                            "val": "The Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) is an Army aviation training system for Active, Reserve and Army National Guard Components.  The AVCATT system permits aviation units to conduct collective task training on a real-time, virtual battlefield in a combined arms scenario by leveraging Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) capabilities.  The AVCATT is designed to provide realistic, high intensity, collective and combined arms training for aviation units.  AVCATT supports the Aviation Combined Arms Training Strategy, Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN), Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), and Unified Land Operations.  A single suite of equipment consists of two mobile trailers housing six reconfigurable, networked simulators that support the AH-64D\/E, UH-60A\/L\/M, CH-47D\/F and OH-58D\/F aircraft.  Other AVCATT modules, such as the Non-Rated Crewmember Manned Module (NCM3, a sub-system of AVCATT), can be linked to this basic configuration, when and where needed, to support specific unit training requirements.  Roleplayer, Semi-Automated Forces (SAF), and After Action Review (AAR) workstations are also provided as part of each suite.  AVCATT is a fully mobile system, capable of using shore and generator power and is transportable worldwide.\n\nFY 2014 core funding of $3.828 million will develop and test the replacement Sensor Video Recording System functionality in AVCATT to meet the After Action Review (AAR) Key Performance Parameter (KPP).  It will also design new capabilities to enhance training when using the AVCATT and NCM3 in combined mode, including improved communications, hoist operations, slingload operations, and visual realism improvements."
