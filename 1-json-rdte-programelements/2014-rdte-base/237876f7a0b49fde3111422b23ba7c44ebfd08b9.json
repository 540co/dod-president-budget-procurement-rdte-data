            "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.\n\n     The Bio\/Info\/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro\/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. \n\n     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems.  The project is exploring novel means to exploit computer capabilities; enhance human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; advance innovative computer architectures; and discover new learning mechanisms and innovations in software composition.  It is also fostering the computer science academic community to address the DoD's need for innovative computer and information science technologies.  Additionally, this project explores the science of mathematics for potential defense applications.\n\n      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.\n\n     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.\n\n     The Materials Sciences project is concerned with the development of: high power density\/high energy density mobile and portable power sources; processing and design approaches for nanoscale and\/or bimolecular materials, interfaces and microsystems; and materials and measurements for molecular-scale electronics.\n\n     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends."

Critical to this endeavor will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and developing predictive, quantitative models of learning and memory.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that provides the ability to understand complex and evolving tasks without exponentially increasing software and hardware requirements.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, which would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will establish a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  The quantitative models of learning and memory will also lead to improvements in the training of individuals and teams as well as advances in cognitive rehabilitation (e.g. PTSD)."

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Beginning in 2013, YFA technical topic areas are more closely tied to programs currently underway at DARPA and to recently identified DoD and National Security needs.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community.  Current activities include research in thirteen topic areas spanning from Quantum Science and Technology to Robotics and Supervised Autonomy, Mathematics, Computing, and the interface of Engineering and Biology.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming\/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.

The objective of the UPSIDE program is to create a high-level, non-Boolean computational model and map it directly to the unique functional properties of new emerging devices to achieve significant increases in power efficiency and performance.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Because Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors, the UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis. \n\nUPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  The inference module will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be a computing infrastructure and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems."

In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time."

During the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal\/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and lone miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD resilience in the face of adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.  Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects."

Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip,\" for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices."

Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.  The radiation dose required for imaging will also be reduced.\n\nThe Basic Research component of this effort will focus on defining the fundamental science necessary for the creation of compact and highly efficient synchrotron X-ray sources.  These sources may lead to future developments in the  imaging field based on tunable x-ray wavelengths.

It combines the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, and information companies with those of DARPA to sponsor an academic base focused on specific technology requirements set by experts in industry and DARPA.  The program will involve close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For industry, leveraging funding and expertise with both other companies and DARPA to solve common technical hurdles in a pre-competitive research model is highly attractive.  From the government perspective this kind of model also provides unique insight into the directions future commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies will be taking.  This perspective assists DARPA in defining the technology gaps where the DoD can make the most out of its limited resources by investing in those areas where the largest technology discrimination can be achieved.  This discrimination is key to expanding technological superiority of the United States DoD.\n\nResearch in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL includes projects governed by virtual academic centers discovering new material systems, devices, and novel computing\/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature it is expected that they will replace the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based efforts currently in NEXT.  \n\nThe STARNet program is unique. It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base, with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD problems.  STARNet has a 5-year duration.  It is expected that industry and DARPA will continuously evaluate STARNet and their respective challenges to determine if another collaborative program is warranted at the conclusion of the 5-year term."

New advances in digital circuits at every element array panel will allow for ubiquitous phased array technology with heretofore unrealized coverage and capabilities.  This program will take a fundamental look at the role of digital arrays and how commonality and aggregation can be affected by emerging capabilities.  Simultaneously, this effort will focus on the development of arrays which can quickly create different unique RF personalities\/capabilities on top of common digital hardware.  The project will demonstrate levels of diversity in the use of the electromagnetic spectrum which is severely limited by the current approach of hand designing the array with heavily specialized RF beamformers that are unique to each system.

Arrays of engineered nanoscale devices will result in an order of magnitude (10 to 100 times) reduction in the time required for analysis and identification of known and unknown (engineered) molecules.  This program will develop novel nanomaterials for exquisitely precise purification of materials, enabling such diverse applications as oxygen generation and desalination, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity.  Additionally, this program will compare the phenomenology of various biological, physical and social systems and abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.  Finally, this program will develop stabilization and scale-up methods to fabricate high pressure crystal structures within domains not previously possible.  This offers the promise to exploit the incredible properties of high pressure phases (e.g, hardness for armor) using economically viable manufacturing approaches."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the tools, technologies, and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e. those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g. flouropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g. self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nIf successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.
