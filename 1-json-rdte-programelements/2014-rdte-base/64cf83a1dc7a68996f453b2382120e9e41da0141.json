            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet\/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  \n\nThis was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.3 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.3 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.3 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.3 PE (0603640M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Navy's 6.3 FNC Program investments were spread across 8 separate 6.3 PEs:  0603114N, 0603123N, 0603235N, 0603236N, 0603271N, 0603279N, 0603747N and 0603782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single place."

All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&T developer.\n\nThis project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.

Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.
