In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the US. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.

As part of the CJCS staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues. JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DOD's resource allocation structures. JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.\n\nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team and provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues."
