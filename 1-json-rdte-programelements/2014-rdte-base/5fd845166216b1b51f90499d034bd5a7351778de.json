The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) \u2013 nuclear, biological and chemical threats \u2013 mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.\n\nThis program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter.
