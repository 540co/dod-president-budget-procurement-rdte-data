Award a follow-on SUGV contract to complete development of SUGV Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) to include a bridging effort to continue SUGV development between termination with the Prime and award of the follow on contract to complete SUGV. Conduct the following actions for the EMD follow-on contract: prepare proposal package, solicit and evaluate proposals and award contract for seven SUGV Production prototypes. Tasks include preparing A Spec, B spec and Statement of Work (SOW). Transition responsibilities and work from the Prime to Government counterparts to close out current SUGV contract and ease government takeover of the existing and future contract with SUGV vendor. Close out the SUGV Critical Design Review (CDR) to finalize current design and assess that design to the SUGV CPD. Utilize prototypes to assess CDR to meet CPD requirements and operational utility, (Oct11-Sep12) under the bridging effort.  Evaluation and assessment will be used to assess requirement compliance and prepared SOW and Performance Specifications for the Follow-on contract.  Assess performance of the Handheld\/Manpack\/Small Form Fit (HMS) Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) radio for range, latency and National Security Agency\/ Information Assurance Strategy (NSA\/IAS) compliance. Evaluate the performance and operational utility of the Operator Control Unit that will replace the Common Controller that was terminated. Assess design and performance for requirement compliance for payloads, environments, shock\/vibration, and command and control software and platform mobility utility.  Evaluate performance of the improved EO\/IR sensor to meet critical Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for day and night recognition.  Award follow-on contract (Sep 12) to finalize design, build production prototypes and conduct contractor\/government testing.  Conduct Delta Critical Design Review (CDR) to confirm design decisions made from the testing with prototypes and changes to the drawing package. Delta CDR will focus on design changes and critical subsystem components: Handheld\/Manpack\/Small Form Fit (HMS) Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) radio, Operator Control unit, Software, Payloads: tether, manipulator arm, CBRN detection and E-TESS. Evaluate design to meet CPD  requirements. Build seven SUGV Production prototypes (Sep 12-Mar13) with payloads. Conduct integration and contractor checkout of SUGV Production prototypes to include payloads. Prepare for and conduct Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) in FY13 to complete EMD."
