Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental\/health laws and reducing the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies to decontaminate or neutralize Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants, as well as technology to avoid the potential for future hazardous waste problems.  Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution  as well as developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army facilities, lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of industrial pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and\/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  Additional work is focused on ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, mitigation and monitoring technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management.\n\nThe work in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the basis for tools and methods to maintain sustainable lands and ranges and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. The specific end results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual munitions constituents (MCs) and munitions and explosives of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health and the development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on human health or the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down.  Performing research in genomics analysis, nanomaterial technologies, computational\/molecular modeling tools for toxicity and exposure assessment; impacts of climate change on chemical and biological processes; and attributes of sustainable energy production further reduces the uncertainty associated with both the probability of exposure and the ultimate effect if exposed.  Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis process. Interim products are US Environmental Protection Agency approved health advisories and criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures.  The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits at Army installations.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this project are fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0603728A, Project 025. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Huntsville, AL, the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA, and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, Warren, MI."
