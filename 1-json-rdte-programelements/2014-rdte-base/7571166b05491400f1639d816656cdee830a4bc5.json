            "val": "The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program developed and delivered capabilities that addressed needs and requirements with direct operational application in the national effort to combat terrorism.  Projects are distributed among 9 mission categories: Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.  This program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners.\n\nFor the Department of Defense, CTTS focused on requirements that support military forces in demanding or hostile environments in Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the Philippines, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. \n\nFor U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  \n\nFY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As U.S. forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces, as well as develop releasable technology solutions that may assist Afghan security forces.  Additionally, CTTS will address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM\u2019s field components as they begin to increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Another areas of increased emphasis will be in the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in locations overseas that need increased security.  CTTS will also address technology and advanced analytical analysis requirements that will enhance Customs and Border Patrol along the U.S. Southwest Border; and will partner with Homeland Security as they identify requirements that will proactively address improvised explosive devices in a domestic environment."
