In addition, includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation. Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations, such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, rents and utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, logistics and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses. Also includes legal settlements. In keeping with congressional intent, PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total MDA budget."
