The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers as networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy\/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided\/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), Program Element (PE) 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).
