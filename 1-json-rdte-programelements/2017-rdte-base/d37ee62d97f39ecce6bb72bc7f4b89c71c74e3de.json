MDA uses the Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) and the Agency's Achievable Capabilities List (ACL) to prioritize technology investments including Advanced C4ISR. MDA's investments balance the pursuit of promising next generation technology with the need for near-term solutions to enhance existing BMDS capability. \n\nThis Program Element includes support for discrimination improvement efforts, which aim to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS effectiveness and resilience against the evolving threat. The end result will be a BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a re-entry vehicle with a high degree of confidence, improving Warfighter shot doctrine and preserving inventory. This effort encompasses Near-term, Mid-term, and Far-term discrimination capability fielding. The discrimination improvements require a coordinated effort between Systems Engineering (PE 0603890C), Ground-based Midcourse Defense (PE 0603882C), BMD Sensors (PE 0603884C), C2BMC (PE 0603896C), Aegis BMD, and Advanced C4ISR (PE 0603179C)\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

When ready, technology will transition to appropriate program elements for advanced component development and integration into BMDS X-Band Radars.\n\nThe Radar Sustainment Contract (RSC) will be used for both advanced technology development and for transition of technology to systems. The RSC is an Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract awarded in 2012 to sustain all the BMDS X-Band Radars. The contract provides sustainment of previously developed X-Band radar products, such as: \n-Software maintenance of existing software developed to support the X-Band Radars\n-Models & Simulation: development, maintenance, and verification of high fidelity models, support for war games and exercises, and support for performance assessment events\n-Engineering Services -engineering support for deployed radars to facilitate maintenance efforts which may include but are not limited to hardware obsolescence studies, hardware redesign, technology insertion, and refurbishment efforts\n-BMDS Test Planning, Execution, and Analysis -planning, execution and analysis of BMDS test requirements for previously developed hardware and software in accordance with the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP)."
