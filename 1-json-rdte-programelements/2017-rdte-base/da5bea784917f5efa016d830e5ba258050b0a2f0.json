            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The effort with Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) continued.\n\nExpansion of SPEAR database:  This database will help consolidate research done by the University of Pittsburgh and enable efficient and consistent data collection across the USSOCOM Enterprise Human Performance Program.  This data collection on each individual type of SOF Operator will allow the Human Performance Program to effectively provide consistent and valid research-based injury prevention and performance optimization solutions that will enable the design of training programs uniquely tailored to the needs of special operators in the most productive and cost effective manner possible.  Completion of this work for each SOF Component will also fill in the gaps of previously funded scientific research.\n\nClose Quarters Combat Performance Metrics (CQC):  Development of cognitive and physiological metrics to measure performance in a specific USSOCOM Operators task: Close Quarters Combat (CQC).  Further, this work will improve the operational effectiveness of the Human Performance Program by developing measures of physiological and tactical individual and team performance in order to mitigate errors and improve cognitive performance in a CQC task using Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Operators.\n\nSOF Operator Availability & Performance Optimization: For research to maximize SOF Operator readiness and availability:  This work will identify strategies to maximize mean time between injuries and minimize mean time to repair, so as to maximize SOF Operator availability and performance.  Analyses of Operator injury history and Human Performance Program participation will attempt to identify ways to increase individual Operator availability so as to contribute to increase readiness for SOF units."
