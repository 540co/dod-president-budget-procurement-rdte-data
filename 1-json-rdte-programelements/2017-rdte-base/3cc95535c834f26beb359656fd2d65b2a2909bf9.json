            "val": "The Army has approved engineering change proposals for the Abrams, Bradley and Stryker programs to restore lost platform capability and host inbound technologies.  \n\nThis Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV).  Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the ECP 1, Operational Needs Statement Lethality (ONS), and ECP 2 efforts.  ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility.  The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR).  The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement.  The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades such as a medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, and other capabilities that will improve suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs)."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command \u2013 Platform (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.  A separate integration effort begins in FY 2017 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, a follow on Engineering change proposal to ECP2, ECP 2B  integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3G FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, vehicle generated smoke, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and, Reconnaissance\/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY) architecture compliance, Environmental Control System, etc). Product Manager Bradley will initiate a Non Development Initiative (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. Begins ECP3 analysis to build a program plan that acquires full buy back of all IFV approved requirements using common technologies with other Army investments."

ECP 1 power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility.  The Stryker ONS Lethality effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR).  The ONS Lethality effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements to include passive and active protection systems.  The ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades (i.e. medium caliber weapon and under armor Javelin), obsolescence, optics improvements and network lethality enhancements."

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  \n\nOn 2 July 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker Operational Needs Statement Lethality effort.  Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), to include prototype builds and technical support to USG testing will be awarded as a sole-source, Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, with the prime contractor executing a source selection for the 30mm weapon station solution.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production\/retrofit contract is targeted for an award in 3rd quarter FY2016.\n\nThe ECP 2 effort will focus on the integration of lethality upgrades such as a medium caliber weapon, under armor Javelin, and other capabilities that will improve suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs).  In FY17, integration of an under armor Javelin capability will be initiated, along with a Trade Study and Cost-Benefit Analysis focused on medium caliber weapon system, and other lethality improvements (to support a 4th quarter FY2017 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) decision).  A competitive EMD contract is targeted for award in 1st quarter FY2018 with USG developmental test initiated upon successful 4th quarter FY2018 Test Readiness Review.  A production Knowledge Point decision is targeted for 3rd quarter FY2020."
