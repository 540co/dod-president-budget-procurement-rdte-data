            "val": "This program element(PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&D) community. Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (projects 720 and 727). This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (project 729). The program includes funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues to provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Ft. Belvoir, VA, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

Effective exploitation of science and technology (S&T) information is critical to achieving the goals established by senior Army leadership.  Activities include Army support for Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) as required by Public Law; the Army Science Board; the Army Science Conference; S&T database management efforts; and administration of the Army's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) in accordance with the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 and subsequent reauthorizing legislation.  Technology transfer activities make technical information available to both the public and private sectors to reduce duplication in Research and Development programs and to increase competitiveness in the US business community.  Database management efforts support development of decision aids, databases, and automation support for the management and execution of the Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) appropriation.

In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of U.S. based small businesses in federal research and development (R&D).  The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&D solutions in response to critical Army needs.  The STTR program expands the public\/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions.  The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century.  The SBIR\/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level.  The Army SBIR\/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs."

Most of the efforts in this project are on-going activities to support Army Research, Development, and Acquisition programs.  Effective exploitation of S&T information is critical to achieving the goals established by Senior Army Leadership for the future force. Funding in this program supports Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of Technology Readiness Assessments as required by DoDI 5000.2.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, The Pentagon, Washington, DC."

The FAST program provides Science Advisors, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&S) costs.  The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers.  The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings.  FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists COCOMS with their annual Science and Technology Conferences.  FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office).FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Materiel Command (AMC), Redstone Arsenal, AL Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
