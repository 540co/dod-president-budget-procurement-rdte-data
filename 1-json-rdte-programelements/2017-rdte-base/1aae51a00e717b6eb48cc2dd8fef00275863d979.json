            "val": "The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E\/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.\n\nThis program provides RDT&E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as \"Block\" upgrades or \"Capability\" updates.  Currently, Block 7.0\/8.1 and Capability Management Updates (CMUs) add capabilities to address Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) requirements. All are collaborative efforts between Seven Nations. Content\/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process.\n\nThe HC\/MC Recap Program will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $9.614 million to account for availability of prior execution balances."

The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E\/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.\n\nThis project provides RDT&E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as \"Block\" upgrades or \"Capability\" updates. Content\/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process. This project will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J."

The CNS\/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 which began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller CNS\/ATM software only updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  Other AMC initiatives are upgrades to hardware and software that have arisen after the formation of the block upgrades and CMUs.\n\nIn order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.\n\nThe proportion of CNS\/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development effort. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.\n\nThe USAF is considering fielding the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates."
