Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations. This project also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. \n\nThis project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DOD test customers per DODI 3200.18 and DODFMR 7000.14-R, which include recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\n\nBeginning in FY17, this project will fund labor for physical security civilian guards and equipment, as well as the UH-60 helicopters. The UH-60 is part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative endorsed by the SECDEF.  \n\nThis project sustains the T&E capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, and Tactical Command, Control, and Communication.\n\nSpecific systems supported in FY16 with continued support in FY17 include: Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Rifleman Radio, Joint Assault Bridge, Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T Inc 2\/3), AN\/TPQ53 Radar, Distributed Common Ground Sensor - Army (DCGS-A), missile defense (PAC-3), Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD), Nett Warrior, XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE), Gray Eagle, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Soldier Protective System M829E4, 120MM Advanced Kinetic Energy, Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR).\n\nDirect costs are borne by materiel developers in accordance with DoD Directive 3200.11 and DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R."
