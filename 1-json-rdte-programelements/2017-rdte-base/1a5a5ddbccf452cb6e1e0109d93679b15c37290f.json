The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train and modernize the existing and future System of Systems (SoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the ST System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.\n\nThis program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY17 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space and while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit system of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC TAC C2 programs to develop and enhance communication systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air control parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield\/assault landing\/drop zone operations.\n\nThe Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
