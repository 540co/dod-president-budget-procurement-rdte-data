Challenges in reducing U.S. vulnerability to a nuclear attack include monitoring radiation levels and exposure in urban areas and mitigating the lethal short and long term effects of ionizing radiation.  A major goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide wide area monitoring of radionuclide signatures."
