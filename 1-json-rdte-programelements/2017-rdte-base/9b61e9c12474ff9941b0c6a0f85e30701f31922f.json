            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Research and Development (R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying most effective business processes. The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs than would be otherwise attainable. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits. \n\nIn December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the agency\u2019s efforts to achieve its mission. As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs will support DLA\u2019s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. \n\nThe three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 17-FY 21 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  \n\n1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.\n2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.\n3. Emergent Logistics R&D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  The SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes."

This realignment was needed to accommodate high priority requirements within DLA to improve the industrial base that supports critical weapon systems. In FY17, $4.646M was realigned from LOG R&D to MANTECH for these high priority requirements. \n\nThe consequences to the realignment include: The Medical On-Demand Business Analytics (ODBA) capability will be delayed depriving DLA end-users the ability to easily access and navigate the data from a single interface without requiring the knowledge of database access language (SQL). The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available. Modeling and Simulation tools will not be available for DLA to optimize operations and logistics processes."

The FINISIM, Returns and Peak\/Next Gen enhancements projects were completed and transition efforts started by J343.  Peak\/Next Gen is being used to set inventory levels for more than 500,000  items, and continues to allow PLFAs to meet stringent Material Availability goals.  A project was initiated to improve the accuracy of PLT estimates which will improve support to warfighters and reduce overstocking. A project was initiated to pilot the use of Vendor Owned Inventory, a commercial practice known to reduce costs through more effective inventory management. A new project will develop techniques to link parts in indentured bills of materials to Service maintenance and parts usage data, and use modeling and simulation to provide a better estimate of demand for those parts.  A Weapon System Demand Mapping project was established to link sales, orders and requisition information to the weapon system the ordered items are used on, which will enable improved collaboration among DLA, its suppliers and its customers. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Planning team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards. \n\nTechnical\/Quality Process Improvements: Three new projects were started in FY 2015. Technical Data Availability will initiate an  attack on the problem of lengthy delays in determining if technical data is current by assessing Services\u2019 systems for configuration          management could be automatically accessed by EBS or some other method. As part of DLA\u2019s initiative in Additive Manufacturing\n(AM), a project was awarded to take parts from identification of applicability through final approval by the appropriate Service, which will clarify the issues associated with obtaining Service approvals and identify some approaches to resolving those issues. The Cost of Quality in Procurement project will identify and document the specific contractor\/bidder characteristics that distinguish the need for oversight, the appropriate oversight actions, and the associated cost of performing the actions. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Technical\/Quality team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards.\n\nProcurement Process Improvements: The Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) Process Improvement project provided recommendations to DLA senior leadership for how to improve DLA\u2019s use of PBL in its operations. A project was initiated to determine the issues and potential benefits of moving PBL storage and distribution functions from commercial sites to DLA Distribution Centers. A project was awarded to develop improvements to the automated bid evaluation process to reduce the number of manual reviews in order to reduce cost of DLA\u2019s operations and reduce the time to award purchase orders.

The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.\n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products. The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the DLA strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available to support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest is the development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.\n\nDLIR is working several short term projects in the area of interest. These efforts are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support."

Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T\/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly.  Other key T\/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.\n\nSelected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical\/Quality (T\/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2016 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.\n\nMedical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  \n\nDistribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes."

Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification. Funding will be reallocated based on project requirements and reclassified into the Strategic Material Thrust.\n\nEnergy Readiness will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers."
