            "val": "This Program Element supports continuing technology investigations.  It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  It provides for Joint munition effectiveness manuals used by all services; development of standardization agreements (STANAGS) and associated Manuals of Proof and Inspection (MOPI); operation of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC); evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition (F24); evaluation of useful shelf life, safety, reliability and producibility of pyrotechnic munitions; and improvement of explosives safety criteria for DOD munitions via the DOD Explosives Safety Board (857). Munitions Survivability and Logistics (297) will make Army units more survivable by applying technologies to reduce the sensitivity of munitions to unplanned stimuli (e.g. bullet impacts, fragment impacts, fast cook off, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, shaped charge jets) and by testing and demonstrating munitions logistics system solutions that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Project 297 also supports the Army Insensitive Munitions (IM) Board's reviews.  The Army Explosives Safety Management Program (858) was established in FY01. The U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety uses the funds in this project to evaluate current explosives safety standards and develop new, scientific and risk-based standards to meet U. S. Army explosives requirements.  The Life Cycle Pilot Program (LCPP) (859) will assess production base capabilities and needs over the acquisition life cycle of various munitions and will address the producibility of ammunition including the transition to type classification and production, and the ability of the production base to cost effectively produce quality products on schedule.\n\nThe F21 Direct Fire Technology and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding is used to support small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. In addition, this program assures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC)."

Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.

Cost Reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)\/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF."

Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production ammunition to maximize munitions battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility between 52 and 39 caliber guns under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU) as well as rifled and smooth-bore mortars. Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale.\n\nThis program will also identify, study, analyze and support fuzing and safe and arm devices. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities."

The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demil capabilities and processes.  Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities."
