            "val": "Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. \n\nSmall Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  \n\nCommon Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical \/ Infra Red \/ Laser Designator (EO\/IR\/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day\/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO\/IR\/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   \n\nProject 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  \n\nProject 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC\/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC\/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP)."

A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.\n\nCSP EO\/IR\/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet a Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP.  FRP was completed June 2013. A three year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDTE activities.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program with fielding through FY2018 and has potential application to other platforms.\n\nThe acquisiton strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle; and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE)support to the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to continue enhancing CSP's usability for the Warfighter to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H\/W) and S\/W improvements."

The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned\/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2017 Base funding in the amount of $1.446 million completes engineering corrective actions and regression testing from Developmental Testing \/ Operational Testing (DT\/OT) testing and preparations for TSP Block 2 Request For Proposal(RFP)\n\nThe FY2017 funding request was reduced by $2.929 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances, ($.929 million decrement and $2,000,000 shifted to FY18)"

The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. \n\nThe TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability.
