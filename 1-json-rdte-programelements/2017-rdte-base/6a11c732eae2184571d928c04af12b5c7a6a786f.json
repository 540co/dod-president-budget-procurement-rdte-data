This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for C4ISR\/EW Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI."

Developed an integrated automotive fuel cell and hydrogen storage system onto an existing military ground vehicle to demonstrate long range silent operation as well as power available at a Forward Operating Base. Developed a roll-up\/roll-away vehicle based alternating current power system to demonstrate the capability to assemble a vehicle based power supply for austere contingency bases. Matured a common military electronic controller to ensure it meets military environmental requirements. Developed and integrated a multi-fuel engine controller on a commercial engine to demonstrate automotive performance gains in fuel consumption and consistency in engine torque. Developed an electrically driven compressor module to run off 28Volts of direct current, providing on demand variable speed to increase efficiency over current engine driven compressors. Improved the autonomous convoy modeling, simulation, and analysis capability, and the ability to assess the impact of autonomy on operational energy."
