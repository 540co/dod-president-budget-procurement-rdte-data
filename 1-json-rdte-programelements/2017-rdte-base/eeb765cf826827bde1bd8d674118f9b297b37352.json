            "val": "This Program Element (PE) includes the following projects: Maritime Concept Generation and Development (CGCD),  Allied\/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID),Fleet Experimentation, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture and Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering. \n\nThe CGCD project (2356) focuses on the generation, development and validation of warfighting concepts, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and doctrine in order to eliminate war fighting gaps. NWDC also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial) under the guidance of Commander USFF and COMPACFLT.  In FY2017 the project will execute a number of new experimentations to include the Undersea Warfare Vision 2025 Experimentation Campaign, Undersea Innovation Seminar War Game, Unmanned Systems Experimentations and Trident Warrior At-Sea Experimentation.\n\nThe FLEX project (3319) (formerly Sea Trial) develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of FLEX is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions.  Focusing on war fighting capability improvement through experimentation aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of current Operations Plans (OPLANs), FLEX spans both operational and tactical levels of warfare and reaches across the full range of military operations to enhance war fighting capabilities or fill current or future capability gaps. In FY17, project 3319 moves to 0606355N.\n\nThe ACIID and SEW Engineering projects (0798 and 2144 respectively) are systems engineering non-acquisition programs to develop, test, implement technical authority, and validate naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures to support naval missions in the Joint and Coalition Theater. The mission of these projects are carried out by multiple tasks that are used to ensure naval C4ISR Command and Control Warfare (C2W) components of SEW are effectively integrated into service-oriented architecture delivering net-centric warfare capability. Additionally, these projects ensure that (1) the composite operational capabilities of SEW systems (not the individual component systems) conform to the naval C4ISR architecture and enhance war fighting capability as related to the objectives of National Defense Strategy, evolving joint visions and direction, such as net centric capability, and are guided by warfighter requirements; (2) that SEW systems and systems integration efforts involve leading-edge technology transfer of information processing technologies primarily through integration of government and commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS\/COTS) products to enhance the Navy's operational capability, interoperability, warfighter effectiveness, flexible reconfiguration, as well as reduce costs; and (3) that SEW systems integration efforts promote the delivery of Information Dominance and the Navy's contribution to the Global Information Grid (GIG).\n\nThe ISR Architecture project (2147) is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). As tasked by the Navy's ISR Council, this effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture."

The ACIID program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment\/Future Mission Network (MPE\/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich Information Dominance (ID) data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as automatic link establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

                            "val": "OPNAVINST 3050.25 outlines the policy to use Warfighting Capability, Capacity, and Wholeness assessments to support the Navy's Planning Programming Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) integrated architectures serve as key components in assessing capability and capacity gaps, enabling analysis of individual platforms and System of Systems (SoS) capabilities in order to achieve the desired war fighting effect.\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has defined several key programs, initiatives, and policies that drive Navy requirements prioritization and impact Navy programs of record.  Major efforts include Joint Information Environment (JIE), and the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE).  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) responsibilities for Information Technology (IT) Technical Authority (TA), Information Assurance (IA) TA, and the Information Dominance Enterprise Architecture (IDEA) will guide Navy's alignment with and implementation of these key, external requirements.\n\nAdditionally, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) N2\/N6 Information Dominance (ID) objectives for Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness, and Integrated Fires capabilities require significant changes and improvements to the Navy's approach for managing its information infrastructure, content, and effects. Potential adversaries will exploit perceived United States (U.S.) space and cyberspace vulnerabilities which could impact U.S. information-handling capabilities and wartime readiness. To realize the ID vision, SPAWAR as the Navy's ID Systems Command, will need to support and enforce implementation of IT and IA TA architectures, specifications, standards, and profiles to ensure Navy cyber capabilities are a warfighting asset, not a liability. \n\nThe Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) provides three main functions:\n1) Perform SoS and platform technical evaluations to establish the alignment with the OPNAV N2\/N6 ID vision for the Navy and identify performance and operational risks associated with the integration of multiple systems to provide a robust, mission based capability; 2) Develop C4ISR\/IT\/ID integrated architecture products; and 3) Support development of and compliance with C4ISR\/IT\/ID systems engineering processes and standards.  The integrated architecture products are used to support the Navy's budget process by providing a current baseline and a target end state to inform decision-making and prioritization for how the acquisition system will deliver new capabilities to the war fighter. The systems engineering processes and standards provide the construct for Assured C2, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires interoperability requirements analyses to identify capability shortfalls\/gaps and to compare\/test alternatives in a joint end-to end environment while identifying associated Navy-wide C4ISR\/IT\/ID implications. Processes include developing and applying criteria for use in Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) and Gate Reviews, and providing technical inputs and assessments to governance bodies. This includes Human Systems Integration (HSI) to provide a mission-centered orientation to ensure effective operational employment of fielded capability. As joint concepts and OSD efforts\/programs are defined and matured, the Navy's C4ISR integrated architectures are refined in-turn, and the supporting C4ISR systems engineering processes and standards work to engineer and enact C4ISR implementations Navy-wide across all C4ISR mission areas.\n\nProducts provided:\n1) C4ISR, IT, IA, and ID integrated architectures to reflect current, as-programmed and future, target states\n-Fit for Purpose\/Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) compliant architecture views\n-Systems Command (SYSCOM) Technical Authority (TA) specifications, standards and profiles\n-Common engineering processes and tools\n2) Supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)\/Information Technology (IT)\/Information Dominance (ID) systems engineering processes\n-Technical standards, architectures, design guidance tools, and policies support to SYSCOMs developing IT systems and connecting to the Navy Enterprise Network afloat, ashore & aloft\n-Documentation of IT interfaces to Navy Networks \n-Certifications of systems and applications connected to the Navy Enterprise Network\n-Gaps Analysis, Analysis of Alternatives, Mission Task Analysis, Human Systems Integration (HSI) assessments\n-End-to-End Systems Engineering and Integrated Design - Operational feasibility studies, technical feasibility studies, technical roadmap engineering validations, architectures and assessment traceability matrices\n-Joint and Coalition interoperability trials - Joint end-to-end prototyping trials; joint\/coalition interoperability demonstrations; interoperability assessments and metrics; and interoperability studies via the Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX). United States Navy (USN) provides funding to the general CWIX operating budget and participates by operating a USN demonstration site\n-Technical analyses for Navy cloud computing options, including cloud deployment models (utility\/data), mission context, warfighting and cost implications and possible implementation options for ashore and afloat capabilities\n-Integration and Interoperability (I&I) - Support Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RDA)) and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) I&I initiatives to ensure integration and interoperability across Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires to deliver ID to Navy warfighters.  Conduct analyses and engineering activities that provide an operational, mission-driven context to the assessment of capability gaps and interoperability seams between Navy System of Systems (SoS) capabilities that better enable acquisition programs to deliver fully integrated and interoperable warfighting capabilities. Provide I&I support in Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) and provide recommendations for updates to acquisition policies and guidance"

They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PORs) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.\n\nThe Naval ISR Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). As tasked by the Navy's ISR Council, this effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR POR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.  These efforts will help reduce Information Technology (IT)\/ISR infrastructure complexity and variance, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) objectives for Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.\n  \nThis effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) spectrum."

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to develop concept\/concept of operations and explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The associated experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment for a wide-range of experimentation efforts including the examination of prototypes, tactical development and evaluation, support for S&T innovation, and program of record system development; venues such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live at-sea events are used to execute these experimentation efforts.\n(2) Provides naval warfare subject matter expertise and analysis expertise to NWDC who plans, executes, and assesses fleet experimentation for the fleets and warfighting development centers (WDC) at the operational and tactical levels. This experimentation is focused on NWDC's WDC integration role, maritime command and control (C2), advanced cross-domain warfighting, and maritime operations centers (MOCS)\/operational level of war (OLW) lines of operations; fleet experimentation seeks to solve fleet-identified warfighting gaps (referenced within the Integrated Priority Capability Lists (IPCL), Urgent Operational Needs Statements (UONS), CUSFF\/CPF Commander's Guidance, etc).  The experimentation and prototyping efforts of the CG\/CD team support the \"last tactical mile\" of many Navy Science and Technology (S&T) programs by supporting those programs where the technology is mature enough, but requires evaluation on or by a \"fleet asset\" - ships, airplanes, submarines, sailors. \n(3) Provides modeling and simulation (M&S) support to Fleet and NWDC experimentation efforts. M&S is used to stimulate decision making during seminar-style and system war gaming experiments and provides the simulated operational environment and capabilities with high-fidelity models such as the Joint Semi-Automated Force (JSAF) program. Additionally, where applicable, the Navy Simulation System (NSS) \"monte carlo\" model is also used to give high confidence solutions and outcomes to complex warfighting problems. \n(4) Provides for focused, solution-driven tactics development and evaluation through experimentation. This effort is focused on developing near-term doctrine solutions to address specific fleet-identified tactical issues. \nTypical CG\/CD products include:\n- Concepts (signed by the CNO that influence future funding and technological development)\n- Enabling concepts\n- Concepts of operations (CONOPS) \n- Final experimentation reports (including findings, insights, and recommendations and DOTMLPF change recommendations and plans for action)\n- Experimentation Analysis Summary Reference Documents\n- New\/revised doctrinal and Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures publications\n- White papers (think pieces) intended to generate further discussion within Navy leadership\nSpecific products are listed in the Accomplishments\/Plans section of this exhibit."

Projects 3319 and 2356 each fund portions of the manpower teams that primarily focus on elements of experimentation design, planning, execution, analysis, and assessment. This same team also serves to integrate tactical\/operational level experimentation campaign efforts with the Warfighting Development Centers (WDCs) in support of advanced cross domain warfighting and maritime command and control (C2) lines of operation. Project 3319 additionally focuses on experimentation expenses such as range time, air, surface and target services, asset support, accreditation and certification, and installation\/de-installation.\n\nConcept generation\/Concept Development\n* The Counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C-ISR) concept was completed, endorsed by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (CUSFFC) and Commander, Pacific Fleet (CPF), and forwarded to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) where it was approved and signed.\n* The Information Dominance Enabling Concept (IDEC) was completed, endorsed by CUSFFC and CPF, and forwarded to the CNO where it was approved and signed.\n* Analysis and information to update the Rail Gun Operating Concept (RGOC) was provided to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA 405).\n* The Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) concept was endorsed by CUSFFC and CPF, and forwarded to the CNO where it awaits approval and signature.\n* Operational Logistics Concept (OpLog). * Operational Logistics Concept (OpLog). NWDC drafted a white paper that describes a concept for conducting logistics in an A2\/AD environment. CPF endorsed and forwarded the paper to CUSFF.  CUSFF approved the white paper and concept development is underway.\n\nFor Fleet Experimentation \nPlanned, executed and assessed the following 2015 experimentation efforts:\n\nBOLD ALLIGATOR 2014 - Digital Call for Fire\n* During exercise BOLD ALLIGATOR 2014, conducted in FY15 from 29 Oct to 10 Nov 2014 in the Virginia Capes operating area, NWDC coordinated execution of a Digital Call for Fire experiment to explore the end-to-end, machine-to-machine transmission of a Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) digital call for fire from a Forward Observer\/Fire Support Coordination Center through the Supporting Arms Coordination Center on USS KEARSARGE (LHD 3) to the Naval Fires Control System on USS WINSTON CHURCHILL (DDG 81) via high frequency (HF) communications path and SIPRNET.\n* The primary objective of this experiment was to determine the exact nature and extent of various challenges that arise when attempting to complete an end-to-end digital call for fire.\n* The results of this experiment will be used by the technical community (primarily Navy Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme) to refine system configuration and troubleshooting procedures that will in turn be used to update fleet operating procedures.\n\nLaser Weapon System (LaWS) Operational Demonstration\n* This very successful Operational Demonstration was completed 13-21 Nov 2014 on USS PONCE (AFSB 15) in Commander, FIFTH Fleet area of operations. The results achieved during a previous experiment, BLACK DART 2012, were so successful that they led the CNO to direct NAVSEA to forward deploy the system to the Middle East. In addition to providing data collection, analysis, and execution support in theater, NWDC produced the final experiment report and a Solid State Laser (SSL) Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMO) focused on operational employment, tactics, techniques and procedures, and command and control of weapon employment.\n\nAlternative Platforms with Payloads (APPS) Seminar War Game\n* As directed by USFF and in support of OPNAV staff, NWDC planned, executed, and assessed the APPS war game completed 12-13 Nov 2014. The purpose of this effort was to identify mission payloads with enablers that would allow selected USNS Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels to support selected Combatant Commander steady state missions.  Comprised of two events, a workshop in September 2014 and the seminar war game, the primary objectives were to: define Navy Component Commander (NCC) identified mission sets; define platform baseline; identify required payloads to support mission sets; identify disparity between platform's baseline and mission payload; and identify enablers to integrate platform and mission payload; and identify enablers to integrate platform and mission payload. The missions examined included: Counter Illicit Trafficking, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Humanitarian Assistance \/ Disaster Relief, Survey Operations, Support to Special Operations Forces, Theater Security Cooperation, and Crisis Response. The platforms considered included: Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV), Mobile Landing Platform, Auxiliary Cargo and Ammunition Ship (T-AKE), and Large, Medium Speed Roll-on\/Roll-Off (LMSR). The findings and recommendations of this effort will be used to inform the USFF\/CPF 2017 POM input to OPNAV.\n\nNavy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) War Game #2\n* The primary purpose of this classified war game was to identify DOTMLPF-P shortfalls to achieve full NIFC-CA Increment I capability at IOC circa 2017. It was part of the USFF-directed and led multi-year NIFC-CA campaign plan that began in 2013 to explore NIFC-CA capabilities, C2 decision-making, training, and CONOPS\/TTP development and refinement. The results of this effort will inform a revised NIFC-CA Fleet Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Fleet Readiness Training Plan (FRTP) development and certification standards. The results will also inform development of future Naval Integrated Fires (NIF) campaign events designed to support future capability delivery and provide capability gap analysis to Navy resource sponsors.\n\nElectromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) Experimentation Campaign\n* The FY 2015 portion of the EMW experimentation campaign consisted of multiple events designed to explore innovative concepts and technologies associated with EMW. Individual components of the overall EMW campaign include:\n* NEMESIS War Game. This war game was conducted by NWDC to obtain fleet stakeholder input into the requirements for and design of a classified ONR Innovative Naval Prototype. The results of this effort will be used to design prototypes that could eventually be fielded as a Navy program of record.\n* EMW At-Sea Experiment. Phase 1 of a multi-phase effort was completed with the results being used to develop new or refine existing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).\n* NORTHERN EDGE 2015. During joint exercise NORTHERN EDGE 2015, held in the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex (JPARC), NWDC executed four specific classified initiatives focused on maritime operations in a complex electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment.  The results of this effort will inform cyber development and develop new or refine existing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).\n* EMW At Sea Experiment. This at-sea experiment was completed in the Virginia Capes operating areas and the results will be used to support continued development of this classified system.\n\nUndersea Domain Operating Concept (UDOC) Experimentation Campaign\n* The UDOC Experimentation Campaign, begun in 2014 and continuing for several years, examines Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions which exploit the undersea environment to achieve cross-domain synergies, enabling joint operational access. The FY15 efforts focused on the evaluation of several innovative capabilities and concepts:\n* Undersea Innovation War Game. This NWDC-conducted war game evaluated the military utility of selected innovative technologies and enabling capabilities to address Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) through Joint Assured Access. The results of this war game will be used to make decisions regarding which innovative technologies to pursue further based on military utility.\n* Non-Traditional Theater ASW War Game. This classified, NWDC-conducted war game evaluated several courses of action for dealing with current operational challenges. The results will be used to inform updates to current doctrinal products and operational plans.\n* UDOC 2015. This NWDC-conducted at-sea event was completed in two phases in the Southern California and Hawaiian operating areas to examine selected innovative technologies and enabling capabilities in an operational environment. The experiment focused on four broad sets of capabilities: antisubmarine warfare (ASW) detection, high speed submarine communications, meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) support to ASW, and submarine-launched unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The results will be used to further development of the extended life sonobuoy program, inform final draft of a new TACMEMO (METOC Geospatially Enabled ASW Decision Support), refine employment of low probability of intercept and high data rate communications capabilities, and further the development of a submarine-launched UAS capability.\n\nLPD 17 Employment Options.\n* Through a series of workshops and at-sea observation events, NWDC examined the feasibility of using the LPD-17 class to perform additional missions as a Regional\/Sector Air Defense Coordinator and\/or an alternate Command and Control Platform. The results of this effort will inform changes to LPD-17 Class ROC\/POE, LPD-17 Class Tactical Manual, LPD-17 manning plan, and other related documents.\n\nRail Gun Seminar War Game.\n* At the request of the NAVSEA Rail Gun program office and in support of USFF continuing efforts to evaluate new platforms and weapon systems prior to Fleet introduction, NWDC executed a seminar war game to inform an update of the Rail Gun Operating Concept, and preparations for the first at-sea Rail Gun demonstration planned for FY16 aboard JHSV.\nJoint High Speed Vessel (now Expeditionary Fast Transport (T-EPF)) At-Sea Experiment Campaign.\n* Conducted at the direction of USFF and in direct support of the OPNAV-led LCS\/T-EPF Council, the campaign's objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of using various Adaptive Force Packages (AFPs) to expand T-EPF platform employment options, beyond that of intra-theater logistics and personnel transport, with an initial focus on mission options that involve little or no modification to the existing sea frame.\n* Phase One of the 2015 effort was executed during USNS SPEARHEAD's (T-EPF 1) C4F Southern Partnership Station deployment and explored the platform's capability to support Expeditionary Mine Counter Measures operations and Maritime Command and Control.\n* Phase Two examined the platform's capability to support Afloat Forward Staging Base operations, Counter Illicit Trafficking, Maritime Command and Control, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance operations using a telescoping mast to extend radar horizon, a small-boat docking facility, and small Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) operations (in conjunction with special forces).\n* The products of this effort include revisions to the T-EPF Platform Wholeness, T-EPF Warfighting, and AFP Fleet CONOPS. They also inform key investment decisions being made by the OPNAV staff regarding the employment of adaptable sensor, communication, and support payloads to enable T-EPF to conduct a range of missions beyond those it was originally built to perform.\n\nTRIDENT WARRIOR 2015 (TW 15)\n* TW15, co-led by Commander, Seventh Fleet (C7F) and NWDC, was completed in 3 phases C7F AOR to include participation in PACOM\/PACFLT exercise TALISMAN SABRE 2015.  The effort evaluated 16 technology and\/or TTP initiatives to close warfighting gaps focused on: C2 of EMW assets in a contested environment, assured communications (Pandarra Net), long range SUW, and counter-ISR.

In addition, FLEX addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps as defined by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces' (CUSFF)\/Commander, Pacific Fleet's (CPF) annual FLEX guidance. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war games, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Navy-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&T), academia, and industry partners.\n\nExperimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities. As such, the FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: Build the Naval Innovation Network, Improve the Use of DON Information, Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts. In accordance with the joint CUSFF and CPF FLEX instruction, the FLEX program is the conduit to conduct experimentation using operational fleet assets. As such, the FLEX program, and associated efforts of the FLEX team, provides critical support to achieve the \"last tactical mile\" of Navy and S&T programs. This \"last tactical mile\" support is delivered through \"at sea\" or \"salt-water\" testing and experimentation at the point when the technology is sufficiently mature and requires evaluation using a fleet asset - ships, airplanes, submarines, networks, and\/or sailors."

The status of the FY15 ExPlan is as follows:\n\n1. Navy Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) War Game #2\n\nThe NIFC-CA War Game was completed 08-12 Dec 2014 at the Boeing Virtual Warfare Center.  The primary purpose of this classified USFF-led war game was to identify DOTMLPF-P shortfalls to achieve full NIFC-CA Increment I capability at Initial Operational Capability (IOC) circa 2017. NIFC-CA Wargame #2 was part of the USFF-directed and led multi-year NIFC-CA campaign plan that began in 2013 to explore NIFC-CA capabilities, C2 decision-making, training, and CONOPS\/TTP development and refinement. A comprehensive campaign methodology is required to synchronize delivery of all NIFC-CA DOTMLPF-P actions and to provide Navy leadership with insight into challenges and limitations associated with NIFC-CA in operational scenarios in order to protect its \"game changing\" capabilities and key programs.\n\nPrimary results of this effort will inform a revised NIFC-CA Fleet Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and will inform Fleet Readiness Training Plan (FRTP) development and certification standards. Results will also inform development of future Naval Integrated Fires (NIF) campaign events designed to support future capability delivery and provide capability gap analysis to Navy resource sponsors. The final experiment report dated 28 Feb 2015 is available in FIMS.\n\nExecute experimentation as laid out in the FLEX Execution Plan for 2015 including:\n1. Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) Campaign Wargame 2.\n\nFocus:\nExecute NIFC-CA Wargame 2 in Dec 2014.\n\nNavy leadership requires awareness and understanding of NIFC-CA capabilities to protect its \"game changing\" potential and associated pillar programs. A comprehensive methodology is required to synchronize delivery of all NIFC-CA doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, and Navy leadership requires insight into challenges and limitations associated with NIFC-CA in operational scenarios.\n\nThroughout FY15, a series of events including modeling and simulation (M&S) development were conducted.  The wargame culminated in an Operator-in-the-Loop (OITL) M&S event. This event examined how NIFC-CA increment 1 capabilities, circa 2017, contribute to air warfare in an operationally representative environment.\n\nObjectives:\n- Inform decisions on:\n     - Concepts of Operation (CONOPS), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Operational Task (OPTASK) modifications,\n     - Training requirements and future experimentation,\n     - NIFC-CA pillar program investments.\n- Investigate:\n     - C2 flow\/decision making\n     - Battlespace management and deconfliction in a joint engagement zone (JEZ),\n     - Combat ID (CID) with National Technical Means (NTM) and 5th-4th Generation fighter integration,\n     - Operations in an electronic attack (EA) environment,\n     - Counter-intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C-ISR)\/counter-targeting (CTTG) impact on red force response (postwargame).\n\nFunctions:\nUSFFC proposes continued Fleet - OPNAV NIFC-CA partnership including:\n- Support a United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC)-led multi-year NIFC-CA campaign plan to explore NIFC-CA capabilities, C2 decision-making, training, CONOPS, and TTP.\n- Inform development\/refinement of NIFC-CA Fleet CONOPS, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) TTPs, and OPTASKs.\n- Inform the Fleet training continuum from schoolhouse to Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) to Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX).\n\nCosting Data:\n- NIFC-CA workshops, fleet participant travel, and Senior Leadership Seminar \n- Workshop included: CID, TTP, Air Defense Commander (ADC)\/Composite Warfare Commander (CWC)\/Rules of Engagement (ROE), CTTG\/Electromagnetic Warfare (EMW), SLS\n- Wargame execution IT weeks, TTP execution check, and final execution weeks\n- Wargame data analysis support\n- Core wargame cost including:\n     - Increased to three BL-9\n     - Modeling and simulation, technical support, and venue\n     - F-22\/F-15 Integration \n     - Manned F-22s and constructive F-15s\n     - Leverages combination of NTM, Info Gateway for 5th-4th Gen FTRs\/L16\n     - Blue EA (EA-18G) \n     - Explicit effect modeling of jammers\n     - Improved capability to support Growler employment\/contribution to integrated fire control (IFC)\n     - Dynamic Red Team \n     - Manned threat fighters, enemy Operator in the Loop (OITL) reaction to Blue actions\n\nParticipants:\n- Subject Matter Experts (SME) from fleet, training, doctrine, acquisition, and test communities\n- Future generations of NIFC-CA stakeholders\n\nDeliverables:\n- Wargame Glideslope\n- Preliminary workshops (CID, Blue Force Laydown, TTP Development, Air Defense Syndicate)\n- Wargame planning, scenario and Data Collection and Analysis Plan (DCAP) development, IT testing and M&S engineering\n- Dry runs\/TTP week\/wargame execution\n- Post-wargame workshop (C-ISR\/T)\n- Wargame 2\n- Counter ISR\/C-Targeting workshop\n- Understand how EMW and C-ISR\/T techniques can be applied to achieve desired results to counter Red force ability to target Blue force location, and\/or disrupt Red force ability to conduct coordinated attacks (ex. simultaneous Time on Target (TOT), threat axis, etc.) based on results of AC-14C.\n- NIFC-CA wargame 2 Senior Leader Seminar (SLS)\n\nAccomplishments\n- Evaluate potential kill chains for desirability, relevancy,\n- Create ideal and realistic wargame 2 mission plan,\n- Provide guidance for updating NIFC-CA CONOPS,\n- Identify operationally relevant capability gaps,\n- Inform resource sponsors of NIFC-CA utility and improvements necessary to achieve capability potential.\n\n2. Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) Experimentation Campaign\nThe EMW experimentation campaign consists of multiple events throughout 2015 designed to explore innovative concepts and technologies associated with EMW. EMW is the Navy's warfighting approach to gain decisive military advantage in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to enable freedom of action across all Navy mission areas. Individual components of the overall EMW campaign include:\n\n o\tNEMESIS War Game\n\tThis Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored war game was conducted by NWDC and completed 23-26 Feb 2015. The primary purpose of the war game was to obtain fleet stakeholder input into the requirements for and design of a classified ONR Innovative Naval Prototype. The results of this effort will be used to design prototypes that could eventually be fielded as a Navy program of record.\n\no\tEMW At-Sea Experiment\n\tPhase 1 of this multi-phase effort was completed in March 2015. The classified details of this effort are available in FIMS. Results of this effort will be used to develop new or refine existing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).\n\no\tNorthern Edge 2015\n\tDuring joint exercise Northern Edge 2015, held 15-26 Jun 15 in the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex (JPARC), NWDC executed four specific classified initiatives focused on maritime operations in a complex EMS environment. Results of this effort will inform cyber development and will be used to develop new or refine existing TTP.\n\nEMW At Sea Experiment\n\tThis ONR-sponsored at-sea experiment will execute in the Virginia Capes operating areas from 10-16 Aug 2015. Once completed, classified details of this effort will be available in FIMS.\n\n\n3. Alternative Platforms with Payloads (APPS) Seminar War Game\n\tAs directed and led by USFF and in support of OPNAV staff, NWDC planned, executed, and assessed the APPS war game completed 12-13 Nov 2014. Combatant Commander (CCDR) steady-state requirements are straining surface combatant (CRUDES and Amphibious) capacities to source and sustain Phase 0\/1 missions. The purpose of this FLEX effort was to identify mission payloads with enablers that would allow selected USNS Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels to support selected CCDR steady state missions. Comprised of two events, a workshop in September 2014 and the seminar war game, the primary objectives were to: define Navy Component Commander (NCC) identified mission sets; define platform baseline; identify required payloads to support mission sets; identify disparities between platform's baseline and mission payload; and identify enablers to integrate platform and mission payload.\n\tMissions examined included: Counter Illicit Trafficking, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Humanitarian Assistance\/Disaster Relief, Survey Operations, Support to Special Operations Forces, Theater Security Cooperation, and Crisis Response.\n\tThe platforms considered were Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV), Mobile Landing Platform (MLP), Auxiliary Cargo and Ammunition Ship (T-AKE), and Large, Medium Speed Roll-on\/Roll-Off (LMSR).\n\tNWDC promulgated the APPS final experiment report on 25 Mar 2015, and the report is available on the Fleet Experimentation Information Management System (FIMS) SIPRNET portal. Findings and recommendations of this effort will be used to inform the USFF\/CPF 2017 POM input to OPNAV.\n\n4. Undersea Domain Operating Concept (UDOC) Experimentation Campaign\n\tThe UDOC experimentation campaign, begun in 2014 and continues into 2015, examines DOTMLPF-P solutions that exploit the undersea environment to achieve cross-domain synergies and enable joint operational access. FY15 efforts will focus on the evaluation of several innovative capabilities and concepts. Individual components of the FY15 UDOC campaign include:\n\no\tUndersea Innovation War Game\n\tThis Commander, Submarine Forces-sponsored and NWDC-conducted war game was completed 07-10 Apr 2015 at NWDC's headquarters.  During the war game, participants evaluated the military utility of selected innovative technologies and enabling capabilities to address Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) through Joint Assured Access scenarios for operational planning phases 0 through 2.\n\tResults of this war game will be used to make decisions regarding which innovative technologies to pursue further based on military utility.\n\nNon-Traditional Theater ASW War Game\n\tThis Commander, Submarine Forces-sponsored and NWDC-conducted war game is being planned for a July 2015 execution at NWDC's headquarters. During the war game, participants will evaluate courses of action for dealing with current operational challenges. Classified details of this war game are available in FIMS.\n\nUDOC 2015\n\tThis Commander, Submarine Forces-sponsored and NWDC-conducted at-sea event, is planned for an August 2015 execution in the Southern California operating area and will examine selected innovative technologies and enabling capabilities in an operational environment.\n\n5. Joint High Speed Vessel At Sea Experiment Campaign\n\tConducted at the direction of CUSFF and in direct support of the OPNAV-led Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)\/JHSV Council, the objective of the JHSV campaign is to evaluate the effectiveness of using various Adaptive Force Packages (AFPs) to expand JHSV platform employment options, beyond that of intra-theater logistics and personnel transport. Initial focus is on mission options involving little or no modification to the existing sea frame.\n\tPhase One of the 2015 effort was executed 13-26 Jun 2015 during USNS SPEARHEAD's (JHSV 1) Commander, Fourth Fleet (C4F) Southern Partnership Station (SPS) deployment.  Phase One explored the platform's capability to support Expeditionary Mine Counter Measures (EMCM) operations and Maritime Command and Control.\n\tPhase Two, executing 15-22 Jul 2015, will examine the platform's capability to support Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB) operations, Counter Illicit Trafficking, Maritime Command and Control, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance operations using a telescoping mast to extend radar horizon, a small-boat docking facility, and small Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) operations (in conjunction with special forces).\n\tIn addition to a final experiment report, the products of this effort will include revisions to the JHSV Platform Wholeness, JHSV Warfighting, and Adaptive Force Packages (AFP) Fleet CONOPS. More importantly, results will inform key investment decisions under consideration by OPNAV regarding the employment of adaptable sensor, communication, and support payloads enabling JHSV to conduct a range of missions beyond those it was originally built to perform.\n\n6. Trident Warrior 2015 (TW15)\n\tThe Trident Warrior 2015 (TW15) advanced at-sea warfighting experiment, co-led by Commander, Seventh Fleet (C7F) and NWDC, will execute in 3 phases from Jun through Sep 2015 in C7F AOR to include participation in PACOM\/PACFLT exercise Talisman Sabre 2015.  The TW15 effort will evaluate 17 technology and\/or TTP initiatives designed to close warfighting gaps focused on: C2 of EMW assets in a contested environment, assured communications, long range Surface Warfare (SUW), and counter-ISR.\n\tTo date, all planning meetings have been conducted, and a significant planning effort focused on ensuring technologies planned for shipboard\/ashore installation will meet installation and Information Assurance certification and accreditation requirements has been completed.\n\tIn addition to a final experiment report, expected products of TW15 include change recommendations to existing doctrine publications and development\/refinement of draft doctrine (Tactical Memorandums).\n\n7. Laser Weapon System (LaWS) Operational Demonstration\n\tThe highly successful (and highly publicized) Solid State Laser Weapon System (LaWS) Quick Reaction Capability (SSL QRC) operational demonstration was completed 13-21 Nov 2014 on USS PONCE (AFSB 15) in Commander, Fifth Fleet (C5F) area of operations. The FLEX program has played a crucial role in the overall development of LaWS. In August 2012, during Black Dart 2012 (a FY12 FLEX event), the Navy Air and Missile Defense Command (NAMDC), supported by NWDC, led the execution of a fleet experiment that resulted in the first successful engagement of an unmanned aerial vehicle - with a laser weapon system - from a U.S. Navy destroyer - USS DEWEY (DDG 105). The results achieved during Black Dart 2012 were so successful that they led the CNO to direct Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) to forward deploy the system to the Middle East on USS PONCE (AFSB-15). Without the FLEX program, LaWS, the Navy's most revolutionary weapon of the 21st century, would not have made it onto a surface combatant and eventually onto PONCE.\n?\tIn addition to providing data collection, analysis, and execution support in theater, NWDC has delivered the final experiment report and has developed a SSL Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMO) focused on operational employment, tactics, techniques and procedures, and command and control of weapon employment.\n\n8. LPD 17 Employment Options\n\tThrough a series of workshops and at-sea observation events, NWDC is conducting an experiment examining the feasibility of using the LPD-17 class to perform additional missions as a Regional\/Sector Air Defense Coordinator and\/or an alternate Command and Control Platform. During the KEARSARGE ARG\/26 Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Post Deployment Brief (PDB), CUSFF directed the identification of potential employment areas that differ from traditional LPD employment.\n\tResults of this effort will inform changes to LPD-17 Class Required Operational Capabilities\/Projected Operating Environment (ROC\/POE), LPD-17 Class Tactical Manual, LPD-17 manning plan, and other related documents.\n\n9. Rail Gun Seminar War Game\n\tAt the request of the NAVSEA Rail Gun program office and in support of CUSFF continuing efforts to evaluate new platforms and weapon systems prior to Fleet introduction, NWDC executed a Rail Gun seminar war game from 15-18 June 2015.\n\tResults of this effort will contribute to a revised Rail Gun Operating Concept encompassing new missions and target sets envisioned for the rail gun and its associated hyper-velocity projectile. Results will also inform preparations for the first at-sea Rail Gun demonstration planned for FY16 aboard JHSV. \n\n10. Collaborative Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) Operations\n\tFrom 14-18 Sep 2015, NWDC will conduct a seminar war game to develop common tactics and procedures for employment of integrated UUVs operating in a FVEY (Five Eyes - an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) environment. Currently each member of the FVEY community is developing, in isolation, TTPs for UUV operations limiting collaboration and information exchange regarding use of similar UUV systems and associated data.\n\tThis effort will produce a TACMEMO addressing UUV operations in a shared battle space that is FVEY releasable.\n\n11. Netted Sensors At Sea Experiment\n\tThis Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) sponsored and NWDC coordinated effort, planned for 14-18 Sep 2015 execution in Virginia Capes operating area, will explore several initiatives focused on technologies and TTP that will improve Navy capability to passively find, fix, track, target, and ID surface and air contacts at extended ranges, largely in support of long range SUW.\n\tIn addition to a final experiment report, this effort will inform NAVAIR (PMA 231 and 265) efforts to shorten timelines to geo-locate short-duration emitters and enhance combat identification (CID) capability through networked sensors.\n\n12. Counter FAC\/FIAC At Sea Experiment\n\tThis effort, planned for Sep or Oct 2015 execution in Virginia Capes operating area, will evaluate the effectiveness of employing an unarmed Switchblade Unmanned Air System (UAS) versus Fast Attack Craft (FAC) and Fast Incoming Attack Craft (FIAC) representative targets.  \n\tIn addition to a final experiment report, this effort will provide DOTMLPF-P recommendations to inform acquisition investment decisions and will recommend revisions to current counter FAC and FIAC doctrine.\n\n13.
