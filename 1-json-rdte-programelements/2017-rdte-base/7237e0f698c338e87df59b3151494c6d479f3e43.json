CRG improves reliability by providing policy, guidance, standards, methods, tools, and training resulting in increased materiel\/operational availability, and initial operational testing success rates while decreasing support costs and logistics footprint.  The UBM initiative identifies vehicle improvements directly impacting Soldier survivability.\n\nAEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, BMD Evaluation Directorate (funded by MDA), C4ISR Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability & Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier & Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a headquarters element.
