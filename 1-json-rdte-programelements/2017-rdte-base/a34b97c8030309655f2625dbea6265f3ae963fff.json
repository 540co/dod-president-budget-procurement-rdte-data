            "val": "The V-22 Osprey is an Acquisition Category IC Joint Program led by the Department of the Navy for the purpose of developing, testing, evaluating, procuring and fielding a tilt rotor, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for Joint Service application.  The V-22 program is designed to provide an aircraft to meet the amphibious\/vertical assault needs of the Marine Corps, the Carrier Onboard Delivery needs of the Navy, and the special operations needs of the Air Force and the United States Special Operations Command.  The V-22 is replacing the CH-46E and CH53A\/D in the Marine Corps with the MV-22; will supplement the H-60 in the Navy with the MV-22; and replace the MH-53J and MH-53M as well as augment the C-130 in the Air Force and USSOCOM with the CV-22.  The V-22 is capable of flying over 2,100 nautical miles, with a single refueling, giving the services the advantage of a Vertical\/Short Take-off and Landing aircraft that can rapidly self-deploy to any location in the world.  This program is funded under Engineering Manufacturing and Development for correction of deficiencies and includes Block A and Block B upgrades which encompassed engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to the production incorporation decision as well as Block C suitability and effectiveness development upgrades.  Capability Development Document interoperability requirements were addressed through a spiral upgrade acquisition strategy.  It was the first spiral providing Key Enabling Department of Defense mandated open systems architecture upgrades for the mission computer hardware and software while simultaneously addressing required interoperability common avionics upgrades and current avionics obsolescence issues.  Future development efforts will include Pre-Planned-Product-Improvements in the Capability Development Document and Re-design efforts to correct critical Reliability, Maintainability and Availability issues  in support of readiness Operational Safety Improvement Program as prioritized by the United States Marine Corps or a Urgent Universal Needs Statement. Development efforts include Block C Upgrade, Mission System Upgrade, Electrical System Upgrades, Mid-Wing Process Unit, ARC 210 Generation 5 Radio, Mission Computer Obsolescence Initiative, Weapon Systems Development, AAR-47 Hostile Fire Indicator, Time on Wing, Digital Interoperability, and Blue Force Tracker\/Netted Weather. \n\nFY17 will provide for additional Aircraft Mission Maneuvering Envelope Expansion, Velocity Not to Exceed Expansion, Digital Interoperability, Software Reprogrammable Payload, Time on Wing and Reliability Improvement efforts such as Improved Inlet Solution (IIS), Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) development as well as development and testing of Additive Manufacturing processes for selected MV-22 components. \n\nThe MV-22 Hardware Development Airframe continues to fund development efforts by Bell-Boeing. Continue development in support of MV-22 Block upgrades and Time on Wing and efforts such as IIS and CBM+. Continue engineering, logistics, flight test, flight test support and address the correction of deficiencies and obsolescence. Continue MV-22 software development\/mission computer obsolescence initiatives such as modular software, transition tech demo and map replacement demo. Continue V-22 Integrated Aircraft Survivability Equipment to include correcting deficiencies of the current radar warning system, integration with an upgraded missile warning and active infrared countermeasure system, and providing integrated threat warning information on the aircraft main flight displays.\n\nMV-22 Hardware Development Propulsion will continue to fund the flight\/engine hours necessary for developmental testing at the Patuxent River squadron. Rolls-Royce will continue to provide engine support and development of MV-22 flight testing.\n\nFY17 continues MV-22 Digital Interoperability (DI), United States Marine Corps Aviation wide implementation of software defined radios, such as Software Reprogrammable Payload, capable of migration to advanced waveforms and payloads, providing enhanced digital connectivity between forces using dissimilar waveforms and\/or protocols. DI will enable fleet integration of new capability through the use of tablets with custom applications.  Digital Interoperability is also envisioned to include logistics tracking (cargo and personnel) with the use of Radio Frequency Identification technology, advanced Electronic Warfare\/Cyber capability, and threat data capturing\/off-boarding.   \n\nFY17 continues MV-22 Software Reprogrammable Payload is a single common payload module that is open architecture, government owned, flexible, and reconfigurable to support simultaneous missions and applications making maximum use of available bandwidth and ensuring interoperability. Provides a bridge and translator to allow various systems\/waveforms to collaborate and provides the V-22 operator and passenger with a common operating picture. MV-22 is the lead platform for integration of Software Reprogrammable Payload Spiral II.\n\nFY17 continues effort started under PE: 0605525N. The Navy Variant Hardware Development consists of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to modify MV-22 into the Navy Variant configuration to perform the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) mission.  The ECP will add such things as (1) the capability to meet the range requirements that the COD mission demands (2) a high frequency radio to transmit\/receive beyond line of sight over water and (3) a public address system for use while transporting passengers.\n\nFY17 continues the V-22 Aerial Refueling System (VARS) capability.  VARS will provide V-22 tanker capability to the Marine Air Ground Task Force, enabling safe and efficient execution of all missions, tactical or humanitarian. The system will allow the V-22 to provide fuel to other Air Combat Element aircraft, such as F-35B and CH-53E\/K, while en-route, in the objective area, or during recovery, extending the operational reach\/duration. With the V-22 deployed onboard, amphibious assault ships would gain an organic aerial refueling capability, maximizing response time and agility.\n\nFY17 continues Electrical System re-design and reliability improvement effort started in the Hardware Development Airframe line. This effort will assess and select engineering solutions to improve the Variable Frequency Generator and Generator Control Unit components. Increased V-22 electrical system reliability and capacity is required to accommodate demands on electrical power system as additional systems are added to the V-22.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The V-22 program is designed to provide an aircraft to meet the amphibious\/vertical assault needs of the Marine Corps, the Carrier Onboard Delivery needs of the Navy, and the special operations needs of the Air Force and the United States Special Operations Command.  The V-22 is replacing the CH-46E and CH53A\/D in the Marine Corps with the MV-22; will supplement the H-60 in the Navy with the MV-22; and replace the MH-53J and MH-53M as well as augment the C-130 in the Air Force and USSOCOM with the CV-22.  The V-22 is capable of flying over 2,100 nautical miles, with a single refueling, giving the services the advantage of a Vertical\/Short Take-off and Landing aircraft that can rapidly self-deploy to any location in the world.  This program is funded under Engineering Manufacturing and Development for correction of deficiencies and includes Block A and Block B upgrades which encompassed engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to the production incorporation decision as well as Block C suitability and effectiveness development upgrades.  Capability Development Document interoperability requirements were addressed through a spiral upgrade acquisition strategy.  It was the first spiral providing Key Enabling Department of Defense mandated open systems architecture upgrades for the mission computer hardware and software while simultaneously addressing required interoperability common avionics upgrades and current avionics obsolescence issues.  Future development efforts will include Pre-Planned-Product-Improvements in the Capability Development Document and Re-design efforts to correct critical Reliability, Maintainability and Availability issues  in support of readiness Operational Safety Improvement Program as prioritized by the United States Marine Corps or a Urgent Universal Needs Statement. Development efforts include Block C Upgrade, Mission System Upgrade, Electrical System Upgrades, Mid-Wing Process Unit, ARC 210 Generation 5 Radio, Mission Computer Obsolescence Initiative, Weapon Systems Development, AAR-47 Hostile Fire Indicator, Time on Wing, Digital Interoperability, and Blue Force Tracker\/Netted Weather. \n\nFY17 will provide for additional Aircraft Mission Maneuvering Envelope Expansion, Velocity Not to Exceed Expansion, Digital Interoperability, Software Reprogrammable Payload, Time on Wing and Reliability Improvement efforts such as Improved Inlet Solution (IIS), Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) development as well as development and testing of Additive Manufacturing processes for selected MV-22 components. \n\nThe MV-22 Hardware Development Airframe continues to fund development efforts by Bell-Boeing. Continue development in support of MV-22 Block upgrades and Time on Wing and efforts such as IIS and CBM+. Continue engineering, logistics, flight test, flight test support and address the correction of deficiencies and obsolescence. Continue MV-22 software development\/mission computer obsolescence initiatives such as modular software, transition tech demo and map replacement demo. Continue V-22 Integrated Aircraft Survivability Equipment to include correcting deficiencies of the current radar warning system, integration with an upgraded missile warning and active infrared countermeasure system, and providing integrated threat warning information on the aircraft main flight displays.\n\nMV-22 Hardware Development Propulsion will continue to fund the flight\/engine hours necessary for developmental testing at the Patuxent River squadron. Rolls-Royce will continue to provide engine support and development of MV-22 flight testing.\n\nFY17 continues MV-22 Digital Interoperability (DI), United States Marine Corps Aviation wide implementation of software defined radios, such as Software Reprogrammable Payload, capable of migration to advanced waveforms and payloads, providing enhanced digital connectivity between forces using dissimilar waveforms and\/or protocols. DI will enable fleet integration of new capability through the use of tablets with custom applications.  Digital Interoperability is also envisioned to include logistics tracking (cargo and personnel) with the use of Radio Frequency Identification technology, advanced Electronic Warfare\/Cyber capability, and threat data capturing\/off-boarding.   \n\nFY17 continues MV-22 Software Reprogrammable Payload is a single common payload module that is open architecture, government owned, flexible, and reconfigurable to support simultaneous missions and applications making maximum use of available bandwidth and ensuring interoperability. Provides a bridge and translator to allow various systems\/waveforms to collaborate and provides the V-22 operator and passenger with a common operating picture. MV-22 is the lead platform for integration of Software Reprogrammable Payload Spiral II.\n\nFY17 continues effort started under PE: 0605525N. The Navy Variant Hardware Development consists of an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to modify MV-22 into the Navy Variant configuration to perform the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) mission.  The ECP will add such things as (1) the capability to meet the range requirements that the COD mission demands (2) a high frequency radio to transmit\/receive beyond line of sight over water and (3) a public address system for use while transporting passengers.\n\nFY17 continues the V-22 Aerial Refueling System (VARS) capability.  VARS will provide V-22 tanker capability to the Marine Air Ground Task Force, enabling safe and efficient execution of all missions, tactical or humanitarian. The system will allow the V-22 to provide fuel to other Air Combat Element aircraft, such as F-35B and CH-53E\/K, while en-route, in the objective area, or during recovery, extending the operational reach\/duration. With the V-22 deployed onboard, amphibious assault ships would gain an organic aerial refueling capability, maximizing response time and agility.\n\nFY17 continues Electrical System re-design and reliability improvement effort started in the Hardware Development Airframe line. This effort will assess and select engineering solutions to improve the Variable Frequency Generator and Generator Control Unit components. Increased V-22 electrical system reliability and capacity is required to accommodate demands on electrical power system as additional systems are added to the V-22.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

As a result of mishaps during and subsequent to MV-22 Operational Evaluation (Apr and Dec 00), the program was restructured employing a phased approach to return to flight and tactical introduction.  The Contractor and Government defined deficient areas within the program\/aircraft requiring correction prior to return to flight.  A Block Upgrade approach was planned, with required efforts identified in Block \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  Block \"A\" included those efforts necessary to return the V-22 to safe and operational fleet operations.  Block \"B\" included those efforts necessary to improve the effectiveness and suitability of the aircraft.  Block \"C\" includes mission enhancements like weather radar, cabin effectiveness suitability improvements, i.e., Environmental Control System, and Forward Firing ALE-47.  Non-recurring development activities are to be initiated and completed for all efforts identified in Block \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  The Contractor will develop specific Statements of Work and Preliminary Specification Change Notices required to integrate the Block Upgrade efforts into the baseline Program.  A Systems Requirements Review, Initial Design Review, and Final Design Review was held for each of the Block efforts so the design maturity could be reviewed and the Government could redirect activities as appropriate.  The CV-22 Engineering Manufacturing and Development program is also structured in Blocks to define an evolutionary approach to achieving full operational capability.  Block \"0\" is the initial baseline CV-22 variant.  Block \"10\" enhances mission capability with the addition of terrain following radar, additional fuel tanks, additional radios, and Block \"20\" includes capabilities such as radio frequency and infrared countermeasures improvements.  Additional Blocks are in the planning stages to continue the growth process throughout the operational life of the weapon system. The Government will issue an RFP to the Contractor and upon award, an Integrated Baseline Review, Preliminary Design Review, Integrated Logistics Assessment and a Critical Design Review will be held to assess the design maturity of the MV-22 Navy Variant. The Navy Variant will add (1) the capability to meet the range requirements that the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) mission demands (2) a high frequency radio to transmit\/receive beyond line of sight over water and (3) a public address system for use while transporting passengers in support of the COD mission."
