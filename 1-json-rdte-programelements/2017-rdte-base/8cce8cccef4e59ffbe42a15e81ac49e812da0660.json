            "val": "The Technology Transition Program (TTP) provides funding to demonstrate and\/or experiment with technologies and concepts to enable or accelerate their transition to acquisition programs of record and operational use.  It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology or concept is first developed and demonstrated to when it can be successfully acquired and implemented as an operational capability. TTP bridges that gap by providing funding and enabling integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the capability developers and providers) and warfighters (the capability recipients and end users) to prototype, integrate, demonstrate, and experiment with candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment in partnership with PEOs, schoolhouses, simulation facilities, and development planning organizations.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities:  (1) experimentation campaigns to support Air Superiority 2030+ promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment, (2) prototyping to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level and assessing implications to CONOPS, tactics, techniques, and procedures; (3) performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition of concepts and technologies from a demonstration program (e.g., Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs)) into acquisition programs of record; (4) assessing external interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the AF enterprise architecture; and (5) capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate technology transition acquisition strategies and gather proposals for technology and prototype development that have the potential for application to the performance of Department of Defense missions.    TTP is specifically designed to deal with technology transition opportunities throughout the fiscal year as they arise, resulting in a prioritized distribution of TTP funding over the course of the entire execution year.  \n\nThe program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems. The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core. \n\nStarting in FY 2017 to improve reporting to Congress, Project  645351, Advanced Engine Development was created to capture all engine development activity that was previously performed under Project 645350, Transition Prioritization in this program.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology or concept is first developed and demonstrated to when it can be successfully acquired and implemented as an operational capability. Transition Prioritization includes research and development funds for the following transition activities:  (1) experimentation campaigns to support Air Superiority 2030+ promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment, (2) prototyping to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level and assessing implications to CONOPS, tactics, techniques, and procedures; (3) performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition of concepts and technologies from a demonstration program (e.g., Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs)) into acquisition programs of record; (4) assessing external interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the AF enterprise architecture; and (5) capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate technology transition acquisition strategies and gather proposals for technology and prototype development that have the potential for application to the performance of Department of Defense missions.\n\nStarting in FY 2017 all activities previously performed under this Project in the Propulsion Technology Transition effort will be reported under Project 645351, Advanced Engine Development within 0604858F, Tech Transition Program."
