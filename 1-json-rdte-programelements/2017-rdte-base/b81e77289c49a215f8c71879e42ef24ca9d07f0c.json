            "val": "This program supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army training and developmental and operational tests.  Project originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats.  Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories and hardware\/simulation in-the-loop facilities.  Army threat simulator and threat simulation products developed or fielded under this program support Army-wide, non-system specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army and tri-service capabilities to eliminate duplication of products and services, while providing the proper mix of resources needed to support Army testing and training. These battlefield simulators represent systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) that are used to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and General Accounting Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Threat Simulator Investment Working Group."

NETT will be used by Threat CNO teams to replicate the tactics of state and non-state Threat and will be supported by a robust CNO development environment. The Cyber domain will be the most rapidly changing domain in which our systems operate.  The NETT program will research these new capabilities and will use an in-depth process to clean, fix, and integrate required Threat tools, tactics, and techniques that will be needed during T&E. Focus areas will include continued Threat integration, instrumentation, distributed collaboration between multiple users, targets and attack visualization, data collection and remote agent development."
