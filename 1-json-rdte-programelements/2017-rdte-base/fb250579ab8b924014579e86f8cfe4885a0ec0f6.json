There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).\n\nThe DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. \n\nThe Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.\n\nThe DoDIN Systems Engineering and Support project performs discovery, research, development and experimentation of emerging and commercial technologies through the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to fill capability shortfalls and technology gaps across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   The OCTO identifies these gaps\/shortfalls, pursues leading innovative solutions from industry, academia, and the Federal sector, and engages industry partners for commercial best practices.  The OCTO develops technology forecasts and innovation roadmaps for existing and nascent DISA programs (Cloud Computing, Unified Capabilities, Cyber Security, End User Device\/Mobility, and Process\/Automation).  The OCTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight of DISA and DoD enterprise products and services.  The OCTO performs early identification of technology needs and explores, develops, and delivers recommended emerging technologies to the DISA Requirements & Analysis Office."

Will identify capability candidates for analysis; perform technical market research, alternatives analysis and trade-off studies of candidates within a defined  trade space; analyze and evaluate existing\/new capabilities through engineering methods to include proof-of-concept demonstrations; and perform technical assessments to develop technical recommendations supporting solution development decisions.  Will analyze\/prototype cloud computing services and open source capabilities for integration and interoperability with DoD capabilities. Will support application and implementation of SDN technologies for Core Data Centers and the DISN. Will continue to enhance end-to-end performance capabilities, including data collection and tools to support enterprise wide troubleshooting and analysis. The results will be socialized with the DoD community for action\/adoption or further development. Where appropriate, the results will also be documented in GTP for compliance by the POR.\n\nWill continue efforts to enhance modeling capabilities that will provide DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models and expand computing infrastructure modeling capabilities, modifying tools and processes to reflect the operational DODIN architecture and technologies as evolved under Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS) and the common informational architecture initiatives and technical advances. These enhancements include: (1) preparing for the FY 2019 Technology Refresh (feasibility analyses required prior to hardware being added to the DODIN) and new user requirements; (2) enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for new or evolving enterprise services and customer needs in DISA program\/project decisions and planning; (3) DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives for CYBERCOM and organizations within DISA; (4) enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning and performance assessments in support of Unified Communications and End-to-End (E2E) security goals of the evolving DODIN; (5) capacity planning for data centers infrastructure computing and network;  and (6) an updated version of the Joint Communications Simulation System.\n\nThe increase of +$1.630 between FY 2016 and  FY 2017 is due to broadened and enhanced modeling and simulation methodologies to properly identify the network planning and bandwidth sufficiency needs of the evolving DODIN."

Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD\/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models.

This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority\/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor\/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts."

These investments and evolution plans identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments to reduce time to field emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. See specific metrics below:\n\nMetric: Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the adoption or influence of the technologies assessed on DoD, DISA or IC programs, projects or services. Technologies are identified by many venues to include research and development initiatives, technology watch-lists from various sources (e.g. in-house, peer organizations, industry and\/or academic advisors) and commercial product releases that have potential applicability to the warfighter mission area. These measures will allow CTO to align technology research and development with capabilities gaps and needs resulting in improved operational effectiveness and efficiencies.\n\nMeasure\/Goal: Number of pilot and technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technical Environment.
