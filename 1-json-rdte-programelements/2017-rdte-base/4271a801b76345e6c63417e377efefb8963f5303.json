The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     Approve component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     Approve component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversee Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Report results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     Review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n (IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

In addition to the 12 exercise assessments, two assessments were performed during visits to operational sites not involved in an exercise.  All DOT&E-sponsored assessments included a \u201cfix\u201d phase during which DOT&E-sponsored personnel helped CCMD and Service personnel address critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  DOT&E also began a new Theater Cyber Readiness Campaign (TCRC) with U.S. Pacific Command involving more frequent and more focused assessment events which helped the command address persistent cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  The cyber Red Teams which supported the FY 2015 assessments used validated cyber Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP\u2019s) and incorporated more advanced cyber threats.  DOT&E initiated a Persistent Cyber OPFOR (PCO) and demonstrated this new capability for more representative and longer-duration adversary portrayal during U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s TCRC assessments.  Fiscal year 2015 evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions."
