As part of the Joint Staff (JS), JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community\u2019s proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD\u2019s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature and affordable solutions.\n  \nJIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the Air and Missile Defense Prioritized List and the Global Integrated Air and Missile Defense Assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions."
