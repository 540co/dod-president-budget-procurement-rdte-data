The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research, development, and supplemental reliability of flight testing efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur and other fleet vehicles (e.g., updates to the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System). \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
