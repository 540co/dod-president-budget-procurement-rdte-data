Capability areas in this project include: protection\/hazard mitigation; detection; information systems technology; and threat agent science.  Protection and hazard mitigation focuses on providing technologies that protect from and reduce the impact of chemical\/biological threat or hazard to the Warfighter, weapons platforms, and structures.  Detection focuses on developing technologies for standoff and point detection and identification of chemical and biological agents.  Information systems technology focuses on advanced hazard prediction, operational effects and risk assessment, and systems performance modeling.  Threat agent science is devoted to characterizing threat agents and the hazards they present in terms of agent fate in the environment, toxicology, and pathogenicity, and focuses on the horizontal integration of CB defensive technologies in support of the Joint Services."

Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI).  Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological\/nuclear exposure.  Against chemical and biological agents, this project supports applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents.  Medical Science and Technology (S&T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents.  Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising device innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools.  \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability."
