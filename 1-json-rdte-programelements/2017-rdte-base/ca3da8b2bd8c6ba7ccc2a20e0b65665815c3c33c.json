            "val": "The Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) is the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) field operating activity in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It provides the necessary infrastructure and support services through a mission execution platform for MDA elements\/components and designated Combatant Commanders' Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) operations executing missions at the MDIOC. The Integration Center is the organization responsible for providing a single, integrated set of skilled personnel matrixed from across MDA to manage this mission. The MDIOC mission facilities consist of a highly secure research and development complex and a mission support module (area) located at Schriever Air Force Base, adjacent to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The MDA Integration Center provides mission critical system technical capabilities and subject matter expertise in a dedicated and adaptable environment that enables developers, testers, and operators to evolve, assess and deliver the capabilities for layered missile defense execution for homeland defense and theater\/regional support. The MDIOC interfaces with the Information Technology\/Information Assurance Enterprise to provide high availability access to worldwide secure communications, network health and status monitoring, mission critical restoral capability, and technical expertise for all MDA directed activities and events. The MDIOC functions as the mission control for BMDS distributed ground tests and system wide flight tests enabling the mission and test directors to control both main and associated test operations using secure voice, test, and mission network hubs from the MDIOC. The MDIOC also functions as the only system-level integration and interoperability mission execution platform for BMDS fire control; and it provides the physical interface between the developers and the Combatant Command warfighters. \n\nMD22 and MC22 MDIOC mission facilities contribute to the BMDS by directly supporting the concept of Concurrent Test, Training, and Operations (CTTO) for the BMDS by providing engineering integration, resource scheduling, configuration management, and implementation development support for MDA and BMDS-level test, training, and operational mission execution. The Integration Center provides engineering and operational integration by: \n\n-Implementing technical event architectures for models and simulations supporting missile defense planning seminars, wargames, exercises, and analyses \n-Supporting BMDS Critical Engagement Conditions (CEC) testing and analysis by operating the Test Execution Control (TEC) for distributed BMDS ground tests, and ensuring \ntechnical system architecture integrity\n-Providing network operations and information assurance for all on-site integration activities \n-Integrating and sustaining the enabling infrastructure, services, and processes supporting the operation of designated BMDS elements and resident Combatant\n Command operations and\/or support centers \n-Providing technical support for the BMDS Watch Officers, BMDS Safety Officers, and Information Assurance Officers in their efforts to monitor and assess the health and status\n of the networks and elements that impact BMDS test and operations \n-Operating the Joint Early Warning Laboratory for anomaly resolution \n-Supporting the Intelligence Support Center for critical situational awareness intelligence on worldwide ballistic missile developments that could affect the development and\/or\n operation of the BMDS\n\nMDIOC Major Program Goals:\n\n-Provide the capabilities and services necessary to support engineering integration, resource scheduling for ground and flight tests, configuration management, and\n implementation development support of on-site activities \n-Ensure around the clock support and restoral of designated BMDS operational activities \n-Improve interface with designated Combatant Command missile defense activities; host\/support the headquarters and operations center for United States Strategic Command\n Joint Functional Component Command - Integrated Missile Defense \n-Continue to achieve cost effectiveness and efficiencies by leveraging existing Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center\n infrastructure, services, processes, and expertise to support assigned missions \n-Maintain and improve the reliability, availability, and maintainability of MDIOC mission critical systems \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

The MDIOC supports the Ground-based Midcourse Missile Defense Mission Control Center Facility, as well as the Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) Integration and Test Centers and the C2BMC Experimentation Laboratories. It provides infrastructure support for the Satellite Tracking and Surveillance System's (STSS) Missile Defense Space Center (MDSC); and the Targets and Countermeasures' (TC) Joint Target Operations Center (JTOC). The MDIOC also provides developmental support to the Enterprise Sensors Laboratory (ESL) composed of a common satellite ground station and sensor netting test bed for designated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) elements. The MDIOC supports BMDS test events based on the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP.) It supports BMDS Critical Engagement Conditions testing and analysis through the operation of the Test Execution Control node for distributed BMDS ground tests. During system flight tests, the MDIOC provides infrastructure (power, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, and communications) support to the Flight Test Director and crew, and ensures the protection of facility and test assets throughout the test window. Further, the MDIOC provides the facilities that support operations of the Missile Defense Element, manned by the U.S. Army 100th Missile Defense Brigade, the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) C2BMC Command and Control Center (CCC), the United States Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM's) Joint Functional Component Command-Integrated Missile Defense (JFCC-IMD) and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Warfighter Support Center. In addition, the MDIOC supports the MDA Operations Support Center, which provides situational awareness of the health and status of the end-to-end BMDS, and provides network subject matter expertise and technical reach back for the program elements and Combatant Commanders. The MDIOC hosts BMDS wargames and exercises in support of the warfighter, and delivers requisite infrastructure to integrate the modeling and simulation assets that form system-level constructive simulations for full-envelope BMDS performance assessment, with surrogate capability for BMDS ground tests. The MDIOC maintains a technical repository of BMDS Implementation Architectures for real-time operations and configuration control; provides state change management and asset management technical support for the BMDS; and provides the technical environment for BMDS Watch Officers, Safety Officers, and Information Assurance Officers to perform their assigned duties. The MDIOC also supports the operations of the Joint Early Warning Laboratory (JEWL), which provides USSTRATCOM with quick response analyses of real-world launches, and rapid anomaly identification and resolution."
