The ADL Program provides DoD, other Federal agencies, and international partners with innovative: (1) standards for training and education software, systems, and associated Web services that demonstrate the \u201cart of the possible;\u201d (2) prototypes and proofs of concept that  harness the power of learning technologies, such as computer\/Web-based training, serious games, virtual worlds, mobile technology, intelligent tutors, and other emerging learning technologies; (3) technologies and learning methods that empower learners; and (4) high-quality, easily accessible, adaptable, and cost-effective education and training.  \nThe ADL Initiative\u2019s R&D efforts improve efficiencies and reduce costs by (1) reducing the need for face-to-face instruction; (2) increasing interoperability--which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content; and (3) researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.  \nADL\u2019s research efforts resulted in the development of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), the current de facto internationally accepted standard for distributed learning interoperability.  ADL is working in collaboration with our partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA will modernize the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new standards built on web services.  ADL is conducting research on intelligent tutoring technologies that support the creation of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).  The PAL will further empower learners with effective learning content that is more personalized and context sensitive. ADL was established by Executive Order 13111, with policy oversight by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Readiness) (Training Readiness and Strategy)."
