This was accomplished by participating in and providing support to Unified Quest wargames and experiments to analyze and integrate technology to identify the feasibility integration into Army space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  The Space and Missile Defense Command participated and supported biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continued to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continued to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developed effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM. Supported TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We sustained our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.  Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3) was upgraded to more realistically address information flows related to Close Air Support.
