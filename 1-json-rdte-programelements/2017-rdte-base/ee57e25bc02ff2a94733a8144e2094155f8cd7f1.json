Missions include the following: line haul, local haul, and unit resupply. HTV trucks transport water, ammunition, and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space.  Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks, as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. Funding in this Program Element (PE) supports the Family of Heavy Trucks to include Active Safety technologies, supports periodic evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy (LTPS), and supports Trailer Development.\n\nFY 2017 Project 659 funding in the amount of $.986 million will be used to begin program documentation and pre-Materiel Development Decision (MDD) efforts, as well as, perform requirements and trade analysis to feed into the Technology Development (TD) phase the Enhanced Heavy Equipment Transporter (EHET).\n\nFY 2017 Project E50 funding in the amount of $5.919 million will be used to start the requirements analysis process through the use of the Dynamic Object Orientated Requirements System (DOORS), as well as, perform a market survey and Whole Systems Trade Analysis (WSTA).  The efforts are needed to meet a user approved requirement gap in the Heavy Tactical Trailer fleet as identified in the 25-ton Semi Trailer Low Bed (STLB) Capability Production Document (CPD) approved 10 July 2014.\n\nFY 2017 Project VR5 funding in the amount of $4.524 million will be used to support the solicitation preparation and rewriting of the Automotive Tank Purchase Description (ATPD) for the HDT.  Funding will also be used to develop and test an MRAP-level armor underbody solution for the M915A5 fleet.  Testing will include automotive and ballistic testing to achieve Full Materiel Release (FMR) for the armor kit."

The STLB is interoperable with a variety of truck tractors residing across the U.S. Army equipment inventory.  The STLB will be introduced into a theater of operations to transport Construction Equipment (CE) employed by U.S. Army Engineers to execute horizontal and vertical construction projects in support of U.S. Military or other national goals and objectives. The STLB is employed to transport:  CE, miscellaneous equipment, disabled equipment, Class IV (construction materials), and logistical provisions.  The STLB supports units in the execution of the following tasks:  expand the lodgment, construction\/upgrade\/rehabilitation and maintenance of Main Supply Routes (MSR), Alternate Supply Routes (ASR), logistical facilities, bituminous roads, helipads, airfields, landing strips, motor pools, parking areas, etc. These types of facilities are required for sustainment operations during decisive action operations. The STLB will also be used during routine exercises\/deployments, disaster relief, and other nation building operations. The STLB will be capable of supporting mobility, counter mobility, survivability, counter improvised and sustainment needs and all applicable North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) interoperability criteria. The current 25-ton semi-trailers were manufactured in the 1968 to 1975 timeframe with an average age of 38 to 45 years. The Economic Useful Life (EUL) of the current trailer is 30-years. The existing semi-trailers have far exceeded their EUL and are plagued with problems requiring constant maintenance attention.  Repair parts are extremely difficult or impossible to obtain due to inactivity or deletion from the inventory.  The burdensome conditions created from the age and maintenance nuisance of the current fleet of 25-ton semi-trailers has placed them in the liability category as opposed to the valued asset category required of units relying on their service.\n\nFY17 funds will be used to start the requirements analysis process through the use of the Dynamic Object Orientated Requirements System (DOORS), as well as, perform a market survey and Whole Systems Trade Analysis (WSTA).  The efforts are needed to meet a user approved requirement gap in the Heavy Tactical Trailer fleet as identified in the 25-ton STLB Capability Production Document (CPD) approved 10 July 2014."

The upgrades will leverage the Army Technology Objective's (ATO) survivability and Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) research and development activities to develop and evaluate kits which increase the protection level of all HTVs to the MRAP protection level as well as anticipating changing threat environments, protection gaps, or improving the operating performance, efficiency, and reliability through armor weight reduction. This Program Element (PE) also supports increasing crew protection by leveraging advancements in autonomous ground vehicle technology via development and evaluation of autonomous applique kits that can be applied to the current and future HTV fleet.\n\nThe Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under world-wide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing, screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant.  The HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment.  The HDT is Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) compliant with armored protection and includes a material control system coupled with the heated bed and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) electrical architecture.\n\nThe M915A5 tractor truck manufactured by Daimler Trucks North America LLC is a prime mover of flatbed and tanker semi-trailers used primarily to transport containers, bulk cargo and petroleum products over primary and secondary roads and trails under worldwide climatic conditions. It has a diesel engine, automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, and a fully sliding 36 inch fifth wheel. It has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 66,000 lbs and is compatible with the following trailers: M872 (34-ton flatbed trailer), M871 (22-1\/2 ton flatbed trailer), M127 (12-ton stake trailer), M967\/969 (5000-gallon trailer), M1062 (7500-gallon trailer), M1062A1 (9200-gallon trailer), MILVAN, and commercial trailers. The M915A5 has two configurations, a base armor-ready A-Cab and an up-armored B-Kit. M915A5 underbody Protection Kits are required to protect the line haul fleet from current and future threats and add protection to the B-kit configuration.\n\nFY 2017 base funding in the amount of $4.524 million will be used to support the solicitation preparation and rewriting of the Automotive Tank Purchase Description (ATPD) for the HDT. Funding will also be used to develop and test an MRAP-level armor underbody solution for the M915A5 fleet.  Testing will include automotive and ballistic testing to achieve Full Materiel Release (FMR) for the armor kit."
