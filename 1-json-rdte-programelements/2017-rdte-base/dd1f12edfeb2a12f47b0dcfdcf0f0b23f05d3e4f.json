            "val": "The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) program is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).\n\nThe AIAMD program is a direct response to the U.S. Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&O) Plan for the Future Force, the AIAMD System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the new Air and Missile Defense Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.\n\nThe AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as \"Plug and Fight\") that integrates AMD sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single command and control (C2) system that will result in overall training savings.  The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established interfaces allowing them to \"connect\" to the IFCN alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. \n\nFunding in FY17 will provide for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Developmental Test phase activities, to include preparation and conduct of flight tests, and First Unit Equipped (FUE).\n\nFielding of the IBCS is the Army Air Defense Artillery User's number one priority.  The AIAMD Program is on track to deliver the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY18. The FY18 IOC will be delivered through fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel, and Patriot components connected via an IFCN, working in an integrated manner.  Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters and Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters.  Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries and Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) components into the AIAMD architecture."

Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters and Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters. Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries and other Army and Joint net-centric architectures to ensure compatibility.\n\nKey principles of the AIAMD acquisition approach are the following:\n-  Migrate from system-based acquisition to component-based acquisition\n-  Use system-of-systems acquisition approach with collaboration among AIAMD, PEO MS, PEO C3T, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization Component Project Offices, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other Service Project Offices to network enable weapons and sensor components\n-  Develop and procure common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components\n-  Establish product lines used to evaluate and select, modify and integrate modular open systems hardware (HW) and software (SW) common configuration items\n-  Conduct architecture-based System Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&T) activities for an incremental fielded configuration of the AIAMD Integrated Fire Control (IFC) Network-compatible IBCS EOC, weapons and sensor system components"
