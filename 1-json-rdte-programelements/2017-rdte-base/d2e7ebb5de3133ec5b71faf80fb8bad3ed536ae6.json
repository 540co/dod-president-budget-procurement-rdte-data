SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations.   \n\nUSSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm\u2019s way.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.
