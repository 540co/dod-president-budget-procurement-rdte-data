                            "val": "The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).\n\nDAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)\/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS\/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 18 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 24,922 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) assertion packages.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n\u2022\tCommon business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);\n\u2022\tAccess to real-time financial data transactions;\n\u2022\tSignificantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n\u2022\tEnhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and\n\u2022\tUse of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition\/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security\/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  \n\nDLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted."

The DAI PMO completed development of Rel 1 Oracle Release 12 Upgrade providing P2P enhancements.  Automated absence management was implemented in two follow-on smaller releases: Rel 1.1 for DoD Educational Activity, Defense Acquisition University and Defense Security Cooperation Agency; and Rel 1.2 for Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Microelectronics Activity.  DAI PMO also procured new user licenses and technology software licenses. DAI was granted Authority to Operate (ATO) from the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA). The PMO developed a Rel 2 Workforce Preparation Strategy; Rel 1 associated Analysis\/ Planning and Reporting Strategy; and a study of hardware hosting options. A plan for a Test & Development (T&D) environment at DISA DECC Mechanicsburg, PA was initiated and later discarded as the center did not have capacity. The PMO conducted Rels 1 and 2 pre- deployment planning and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) with current and prospective agencies and completed Rels 1 and 2 Systems Engineering (SE) Technical Reviews including five Rel 1 simulation mocks with the agencies.  DAI PMO was awarded DAI Inc 2 Rel 1 Interim Joint Interoperability Certification, a Rel 1 limited fielding decision by Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) April 21, 2015 and an Acquisition Program Baseline on February 8, 2015.  DAI PMO migrated all existing users and their data to the DAI Increment 2 Rel 1 production baseline on May 4, 2015.  After Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) revised the DoD\u2019s Federal Financial Management Requirements (FFMRs) in DFAS Blue Book (August 2014), DAI successfully completed an independent review of a regression test of a sample the revised basket of FFMRs (95% compliant).  Later, DAI PMO began an assessment against all 797 applicable Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requirements (91% complete as of September 8, 2015).  DAI PMO successfully completed an independent Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) Test of Design\/Test of Effectiveness. The PMO deployed Rel 2 to existing users and to additional users within these agencies.  DCMA. DAU, DODEA and DMEA began using DAI for financial management. Also in FY15, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) completed an operational assessment of with several using agencies.  JITC found that DAI is making satisfactory progress towards meeting Operational Effectiveness, Suitability, Interoperability, and Cybersecurity (OESIS).  For Usability, Training, Sustainment, and Auditability, users reported no major issues or discrepancies during the OA. Survey comments were generally favorable in the areas of system Usability, Training, Help Desk, Configuration Management, Audit Trails, and Business Process accomplishment. Users demonstrated interoperability through successful completion of all mission tasks in all Business Process areas. Reliability and Operational Availability metrics were favorable; however, the prevalent issue reported by users was excessive system response time.  PMO also conducted system tuning during Q1 to address this issue and reduced Rel 2 average response time from just over 5 seconds to 2.04 seconds as of December 3, 2015."
