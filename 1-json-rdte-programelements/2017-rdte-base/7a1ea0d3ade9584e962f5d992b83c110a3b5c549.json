            "val": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Preparedness Manufacturing Technology (IP ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters\u2019 needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  \n\nBeginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  \n\u2022\tThe Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization\u2014Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  \n\u2022\tMaintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. \n\u2022\tThe Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging \u201cModel Based Enterprise\u201d paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected."

Rations processed through MATS should offer substantial cost benefits over current retorted or thermally processed rations due to fast heating rate, high energy efficiency, increased production, reduced labor, improved quality, and a flexibility of differential heating for multi-components trays or pouches to preserve the optimal quality of individual components.  MATS will also produce products with better taste and texture, higher nutrient retention, longer shelf life, greater menu variety, and ultimately greater consumption of rations and less food waste.  \n\nSpecific technical achievements of the MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will include evaluating various alternate sealant layers and test them for acid resistance, as well as overall performance in the MRE ration ultimately leading to the identification and production of alternate sealant layers for high acidic foods. The project will mitigate current risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials. Additionally, through this project the use of glass bottles for hot sauce and eliminating pouches for more viscous products such as ketchup and mustard that might not have a three-year shelf life.  \n\nSpecific technical achievements of the Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring will include achieving a level of new regulatory compliance via monitoring temperature variations in the San Joaquin, CA warehouse where subsistence is being stored and assembled into Unitized Group Rations. The results will identify a range of cost effective device solutions and storage mediation practices. The solution sets will determine shelf life (food quality and safety) degradation to ration components (pre and post assembly) and improve information to the customer.\n\nSpecific technical achievements of the Optimize Combat Rations Inspection Costs will include reducing inspection cost performed by two government agencies and ration producer through the elimination of duplicate tests for the same quality attribute that is performed.  Based on internal reviews and assessments, proposed solutions will be identified and further evaluated for optimal inspection frequencies and sample sizes in order to minimize cost while maintaining quality and safety goals. The optimized inspection methods that show the most promising strategies and solutions (biggest cost impacts) and quickest return on investment without sacrificing overall product quality for the customer will be verified.\n\nAt least 50% of the completed short-term projects will transition in 2016, and OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved."

The lead-time is up to 15 months for these items. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014, and the results have been implemented DOD wide for recruit items. Residual CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) Program. The MUST Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain."

Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems. The increase in funding will help develop new technology for casting suppliers, including inspection, materials, modeling, and design."

Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.  The increase in funding will help develop new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and most expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying\/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices."

MAE also made significant progress in the development of higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities which, when transitioned into full-scale production, will further increase DLA\u2019s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE also initiated new implementations including development of an Advanced Schottky TTL Capability. It will continue prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs"

Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition & Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing & Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge\/Sustainment, and Technology Transition\/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups, is informed of general R&D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF)."

Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  \n\nThis SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  \n\nThe Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.\n\nThe Subsistence Supply Chain consists of military subsistence, which includes combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and market fresh products. The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is a manufacturing technology program and is the successor to the Combat Rations R&D program. SUBNET\u2019s community of practice will research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. The desired outcomes of the current short-term projects Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project  include testing of low risk, high-impact technology and process improvements that will improve the quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce cost, and provide efficiencies, then transitioning these improvements to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers.   \n\nThe Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA\u2019s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler."

The government plans to invest up to $18 million during Fiscal Years 2016-2021 for funding research in response to this BAA.  Through the SUBNET STPs, research and development projects will be conducted and directed toward improving existing DLA processes and to improve manufacturing and delivery of combat rations and other subsistence products. Two of the STPs will be completed and transitioned in FY16. That is, the Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) and the MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate Project. The Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) goal is to reduce the cost of current combat ration entrees using MATS versus Retort, which is projected to be a 40% reduction in cost based on the energy savings per pouch of 50% MATS versus Retort. The cost reduction is projected to be higher when ration waste is considered as a result of poor reception of retorted ration entrees by the warfighters.  For the project optimize combat rations inspection costs, the objective is to establish an inspection system that captures the cost of quality that includes inspection of incoming material, in-process and end item inspections. The baseline for inspection was established for two retort products and one assembled meal. Analytical testing protocols have been reassessed for two products leading to a 58% reduction in cost. The combat ration shelf life temperature monitoring through data loggers provided a method to monitor the temperature distribution in the warehouse where unitized group rations are stored. The project includes tasks to develop solution sets for an optimal method of determining the rate of the shelf life degradation of rations and contents and a method to convey information to the receiver of the product at time of shipment. A 9 F degree reduction in temperature was achieved during the summer of 2015 as compared to 2014, leading to significant shelf life retention. The MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will mitigate the risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials.  Investments in these projects and future short-term projects will improve quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce costs, increase production, and provide efficiencies. \n\nThe Castings consortium plan is to complete some existing projects towards the end of FY16 and into FY17. The new BAA will be released in FY16, with award(s) planned for 1st quarter FY17.  Plan to complete new welding procedures and post-weld heat treatments to restore mechanical properties of the welded areas of Eglin Steel, a high strength steel, and hence its strength and integrity.\n\nThe Forgings consortium plan is to continue working projects recently awarded in FY15.  The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014 using additional funds planned to begin in FY16.\n\nThe Battery Network plan is to identify and award new Short Term Projects (STP) with an expected duration of 18-24 months and an average annual funding of $200K-$500K. Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Battery Network will also pursue additional battery manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.  \n\nThe Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.\n\nFY 16 \u2013 FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust."

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as \u201cnon-procurable.\u201d This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  \n\nThe Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM\/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD\u2019s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  \n\nThe Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements."

MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capability.

This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.\n\nThe MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a \u201cknowledge-based approach\u201d to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an \u201celectronic paper\u201d (i.e. PDF\/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.\n\nThe DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   \n\nThe Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models."
