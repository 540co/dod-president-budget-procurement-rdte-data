            "val": "Discrimination Sensor Technology develops solutions to improve identifying, acquiring, tracking and discriminating incoming Ballistic Missile threats, supporting the US Strategic Command's Prioritized Capabilities List.  Areas of concentration include advanced detectors, infrared sensors, focal planes and algorithms for ground, sea, air and space systems. Sensor technology enhances the BMDS capability to develop precision tracks and to discriminate lethal objects among the incoming threat cluster. \n\nThe Discrimination Sensor Technology program funds the demonstration of Aegis Launch on Remote real time stereo tracking with Multi-Spectral Targeting System -Cs integrated into MQ-9 Reapers.  Aegis Launch on Remote is the capability that allows Aegis BMD to launch an interceptor before its own radar acquires the threat, greatly expanding the space where the Aegis BMD can intercept the threat and significantly extending the defended area.  In FY 2014, the MDA was successful in testing the Multi-Spectral Targeting System -B variant integrated onto the MQ-9 Reaper at the Pacific Missile Range Facility proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile-3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne Multi-Spectral Targeting System sensors.  In FY 2015, Discrimination Sensor Technology performed System Integration Laboratory and ground testing in preparation for flight testing  the MQ-9 with a Multi-spectral Targeting System -C  and flew the Reaper in missile defense configuration (Multi-spectral Targeting System -C mounted on a forward fuselage extension, a Ruggedized Airborne Processor and special software)  for the first time.  In FY 2016, the MDA will participate in Controlled Test Vehicle -02 (CTV-02) to test Multi-Spectral Targeting System equipped MQ-9 Reapers specifically modified to accomplish missile defense tracking missions.  \n\nThe MD95, Discrimination Sensor Technology project, funds the prime contract integration and system test, checkout flights, and performance analysis.  Discrimination Sensor Technology incrementally builds on the airborne Multi-Spectral Targeting System -B Launch on Remote demonstrations using airborne Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  The Discrimination Sensor Technology program will demonstrate the increased Electro Optical\/Infrared capability of Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C airborne sensors for precision track Launch on Remote and discrimination over Multi-Spectral Targeting System -Bs as a precursor to advanced sensor equipped Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C prototype development and test under the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element.  \n\nThe MT95, Discrimination Sensor Technology Flight Test Execution project, funds the costs associated with Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C\/MQ-9 Reaper participation in BMDS testing including prime contract test execution, MQ-9 operations and maintenance, and Enterprise Sensors Laboratory and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Center interfaces. \n\nMDA collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the United States Navy and the United States Air Force in a systems engineering based strategy to research, develop, test and evaluate Discrimination Sensor Technology.  The Discrimination Sensor Technology test program includes Air Force provided F-16 aircraft for use as surrogate targets and sharing of Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C test data between the MDA and the Air Force to augment sensor characterization activities.  \n\nThis technology significantly enhances the following BMDS priorities: \n\n- Precision track of multiple objects to enable missile defense components to engage-on-remote\n- Discriminating lethal objects from countermeasures\n- End-to-end correlation of sensor track and discrimination data\n\nThe Discrimination Sensor Technology program element development and test results directly feed sensor prototype demonstrations in the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element 0604115C.  \n\nMC98, Cyber Operations, sustains the MDA DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program and Controls Validation Testing activities for Discrimination Sensor Technology.\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

This project evaluates and researches emerging technology that enables game changing discrimination improvements for incorporation into next generation interceptors and air or space systems.  The Discrimination Sensor Technology project pursues a cost-effective incremental upgrade philosophy that demonstrates airborne precision tracking and improved track performance and discrimination of missile threats.  These advanced sensors improve the probability of engagement success for stressing threats, expand the BMD battle space and increase the ability to negate larger raid sizes. \n\nThe MD95, Discrimination Sensor Technology project, funds the prime contract integration and system test, checkout flights, and performance analysis.  In FY 2015, Discrimination Sensor Technology performed System Integration Laboratory and ground testing in preparation for flight testing the MQ-9 with a Multi-spectral Targeting System -C and flew the Reaper in missile defense configuration (Multi-spectral Targeting System -C mounted on a forward fuselage extension, a Ruggedized Airborne Processor and special software) for the first time.  \n\nThe MDA's sensor technology construct incrementally buys down risk by testing an evolving sensor technology first on the ground then on unmanned aerial vehicles.  Discrimination Sensor Technology also measures resident space objects and targets of opportunity to characterize performance before participating in BMDS tests. Discrimination Sensor Technology interfaces with the existing BMDS architecture to develop three-dimensional tracks of the ballistic missile, which are sent via Link-16 to Aegis ships for engagement."

Aegis Launch-on-Remote capability allows Aegis BMD to launch an interceptor before its own radar acquires the threat, thus expanding Aegis BMD's defended area.  Aegis BMD Launch-on-Remote involves Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications providing information about the paths (called tracks) of ballistic missile threats, to Aegis BMD from forward based radars.  The MT95, Discrimination Sensor Technology flight test project leverages other BMDS tests as an associated operation to gather sensor data. \n\nIn FY 2015, MDA successfully tested two Multi-Spectral Targeting System -B sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reapers.  The Discrimination Sensor Technology tests used the BMDS operational architecture, proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile - 3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne Multi-Spectral Targeting System sensors. \n\nIn FY 2016, the Discrimination Sensor Technology Flight Test project tests two Multi-Spectral Targeting System -Cs integrated into MQ-9 Reapers to demonstrate increased track precision and discrimination capability for the BMDS.  As a precursor to the BMDS testing, the MDA is partnering with the Air Force to characterize Multi-Spectral Targeting System performance and provide data for Air Force Air Dominance development planning.\n\nThe Discrimination Sensor Technology Flight Test project funds flight, operations and maintenance costs for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, ground control stations and ground support equipment.  It also funds shipping of the test assets to test ranges, labor, travel, range support and Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications test support specific to Discrimination Sensor Technology. \n\nThe results from this airborne Multi-Spectral Targeting System -C Launch-on-Remote test sequence mature the critical technologies necessary for prototype development under the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element 0604115C.  Launch-on-Remote is the precursor to Engage-on-Remote, which significantly expands BMD reach and the defended area."
