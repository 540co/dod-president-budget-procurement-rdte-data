The CJCS approved four new joint concepts that were completed and began implementation planning in FY 2015:  Joint Concept for Rapid Aggregation, Joint Concept for Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, Joint Concept for Logistics version 2.0, and Joint Concept for Health Services.  Seven Joint Concepts were initiated and will be completed in FY16:  Joint Concept for Cyberspace, Joint Concept for Preventing the Use or Transfer of WMD, Joint Concept for Human Aspects in Military Operations, Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons, Joint Concept for Robotic and Autonomous Systems, Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment, and Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning.  The FY15 update of the Joint Operational Access Implementation Plan was completed and approved by the CJCS in August 2015 and work has begun on the FY16 update.  An update of two key joint force development documents were initiated:  the CJCS\u2019s Capstone Concept for Joint Operations that describes the vision for how joint forces will operate in the future and guides all joint force development; and the DJ-7\u2019s Joint Operating Environment that describes military joint force challenges based on the anticipated future security environment of 2035.  An update of the CJCSI 3010 began with expected completion in FY 2016.  Twelve joint concepts were archived after extensive staffing and approval by the DJS during Phase I of a legacy concept review.  Fourteen joint concepts are under review for archiving in FY 2016 as part of Phase II of a legacy concept review.\n\nThe draft Joint Concept for Robotics and Autonomous Systems was evaluated in an analytic workshop as part of the concept development process, and produced refined ideas to shape the Department\u2019s approach to the impact of robotics and autonomous systems to Joint Warfighting over the next 20 years.\nAs a result of concept assessment of the Chairman\u2019s Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, feedback was provided to inform DoD decision making on Goldwater-Nichols Act reviews including that Senior leaders require integrated processes to develop and implement global crisis-response options, anticipate cross-CCMD challenges, assess risk, make timely resource allocation decisions, integrate special capabilities, and communicate strategic priorities.      \n\nSpecific results:\n\n- recommended re-examining above CCMD C2 measures to support global decision-making during high-demand multi-AOR crises.  This TTX also developed ways to accelerate logistics planning and improve feasibility of CCDR estimates prior to the CJCS\/SECDEF review.  \n- suggest global synchronization is impacted at two levels: (1) above CCMD through strategic guidance, authorities, resource allocation, and risk assessment; and (2) across-CCMD through access, force sharing, information sharing, and the harmonizing of actions.  This SLS deliberated the challenges in force management, pre-conflict cross-CCMD coordination, shared battle rhythms, and supported\/supporting command relationships.  \n- identified ways to integrate Defense and National Intelligence systems for more effective collection management and more agile ISR and PED resource management.  Initiatives seek improved asset awareness across the globe, better management tools, and expanded force management authorities.  IB 15-3 results provide timely information to DoD leadership as they consider changes to the Unified Command Plan (UCP) and other ways to overcome global ISR challenges.\n\nIMPACTS:  The IRON CRUCIBLE Series influences senior leaders\u2019 perspectives on global synchronization and continues to expand DoD understanding of critical requirements for global agility and global synchronization.  Event reports and writings on global agility have impacted senior Department leaders and contribute to the narrative on innovation and efficiencies in the 2015 NMS.  The Series has produced 30 recommendations for force development in the areas of policy, doctrine, and training."

The Joint Staff Operations Directorate (J3) is the functional leader for GFM Allocation and GFM Mission Applications.  Accordingly, TJS will employ a joint strategy for efficiently fulfilling Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nThe DoD must quickly transition from legacy systems that promulgate data disparity across the Defense enterprise in order to meet the National Military Objectives that have evolved from large force scenarios to operations that include small-to-full scale activities.

This yields value-added non-materiel solutions, lessons learned, and best practices across the Doctrine, Organization,Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities - Policy (DOTMLPF-P).  This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force capabilities, and are measured by the following:\n\n(1) Meet Initial Operating Capability (IOC) performance elements.\n\n(2) Enterprise Force Structure Data services and Web Service Interfaces supporting a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog (JFCC) described in the Enterprise Force\nStructure (EFS) Capability Package (CP) that is essential to operationalizing the force structure data and achieve GFM DI Next Steps Allocation.\n\n(3) Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff and OSD will be able to efficiently manage force generation supporting GFM Allocation in less than the current time it takes with a\ncommon view of the sourcing-to-employment tracking of forces. This is realized by the automated linking of the Organization Unique Identifier (OUID) attributes from the GFM DI Org Servers (OS) to the Unit Identification Code (UIC) resident in JOPES TPFDDs, GFM allocation information (FTN, RFF, and DEPORD\/LNR), and\nTransportation data.\n\n(4) GFM applications that allow a Joint Planner to inculcate the association of standard and consistent force structure instance data and consistently applied data\n\"types\" with force structure data referenced over time in the GFM Allocation sourcing solutions and deployment planning,execution, and distribution processes."
