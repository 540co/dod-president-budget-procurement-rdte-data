The SSDP is a Joint Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) organization established to function as the center of excellence for options and strategies (materiel, non-materiel, cross-Title, cross-domain) leading to a more resilient and enduring National Security Space (NSS) Enterprise.  The SSDP Operates under the authority of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) to lead and collaborate on space protection vulnerability, susceptibility, and mitigation assessments of NSS services for the purpose of identifying and introducing protection recommendations into existing requirements, budgeting, acquisition, and operational development processes.  This unique mission provides an ongoing and crucial core protection competency that advances specific projects\/activities (including cyber) to deliver comprehensive, economical and actionable solutions for both programmatic and operational domains.  \n\nThe SSDP scope spans multiple space missions and stakeholders including the DoD, Intelligence Community (IC), civil, commercial, and international space entities that support NSS missions in both peacetime and throughout all phases of conflict.  It is focused on being responsive to NSS stakeholders in providing technical and operational assessments of emergent threat concepts, and developing near- and far-term plans to address strategies, threats, and vulnerabilities. Specific SSDP Projects are structured\/designed to have an impact across all time horizons; near-term focused efforts to complicate adversary operations, mid-term focused efforts to improve system and enterprise survivability, and long-term focused efforts to render adversary capabilities ineffective.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Individual projects, both in house and in coordination with our mission partners, will work to validate candidate solutions through various means, such as technical analysis, Modeling & Simulation (M&S), and operator engagement.  They will:  Pursue new P&D solutions, develop CONOPS for both programmed and proposed systems, use M&S resources to mature and shape CONOPS, document architectures and inform programmatic decisions, and utilize experiment results along with M&S recommendations to influence NSS Enterprise requirement and architecture choices.  Projects will include prototyping and experimenting with BMC2, SSA and Space Control concepts, planned capabilities and TTPs.  Projects will be executed in SSDP labs, mission partner facilities, and often in coordination with the JSpOC, JICSpOC, and NROC.  They will incorporate objectives to demonstrate DoD\/IC space protection coordination as well as explore data fusion including the integration of commercial tools & services.  SSDP will:  Continue independent review and assessment for programmatic planning and architectures covering DoD, IC and Civil space operations; engage on strategic protection and policy integration efforts across all facets of the NSS Enterprise; and work with the NSS community to incorporate P&D requirements into policy and guidance to drive future program development and execution.  M&S resources will be used to conduct architecture trades at both the enterprise and system level to identify the right mix of systems to meet NSS requirements and examine how those systems should be integrated."
