The overall objective is to ensure validation of weapon system accuracy and reliability by developing aerial and ground targets essential for test and evaluation (T&E). These targets are economical and expendable, remotely controlled or stationary, and often destroyed in use. The Army is the Tri-Service lead under Reliance for providing rotary wing, mobile ground, towed, and designated targets for T&E. The Army executes development of some Service-peculiar target requirements in support of quality assurance, lot acceptance, and training and continues development of Service-peculiar and on-going target materiel upgrades to maintain continuity with current weapons technology and trends in modern and evolving Army weapons."

Modern weapons require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess their effectiveness on the battlefield.  This program encompasses a family of rotary and fixed-wing targets; full-scale, miniature, and subscale targets; virtual targets; ancillary devices; and their control systems.  These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing test and evaluation (T&E).  In order to stress systems during T&E, aerial targets must have flight characteristics, signatures, and other performance factors that emulate the modern threat.  This program includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation process; execution of the validation process to ensure that surrogate targets adequately represent the threat; development and acquisition of surrogate and acquired targets; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development\/enhancement\/update via engineering services of the developed and acquired threat targets to ensure availability for the T&E customer.  The Army is the Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and towed target developments and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing target."

The MGTO provides support and oversight for actual threat foreign ground vehicles and mobile ground target surrogate vehicles for use as threat targets by the T&E community for destructive and non-destructive scenarios. Efforts will support users such as ATEC, Apache 64E, GMLRS, Brigade Modernization Command, KIOWA, JAGM, Gray Eagle, Add PM Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV), and others."
