The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale."

This is part of an overall Agency rebalancing of near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities. Other reductions were in support of Departmental efficiencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and economic assumptions. Reductions to the RDT&E portfolio impacted investment in efforts with lower return on investment, lower customer demand, or that were early in the development cycle."

This effort supports Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in the technology readiness level.

In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the US Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&D). As the central NTNF R&D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions. NTNF R&D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the relative effect of the increased investment in FY 2015 as a result of the Congressional Add for Technology Solutions Supporting Operations in Subterranean Environments.  This investment was realigned during FY 2015 from Project RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies to better reflect the nature of the investment.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities."

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.  The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The Radiation hardened nanoelectronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nanoelectronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  The Human Survivability supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in Nuclear Surety.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in radiation hardened nanoelectronics and nuclear weapons stockpile logistics."

These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities\/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.  Note: This is a new funding line established to rapidly transition capabilities to programs of record.\n\nThe increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the transition of nuclear effects modeling applied research efforts to advanced technology development."

The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge. This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets and to (2) assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack). These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the projected completion of the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software."
