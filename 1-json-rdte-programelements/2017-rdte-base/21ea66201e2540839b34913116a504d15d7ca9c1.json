The PE supports personnel compensation for HQ-assigned civilians, along with related administrative support costs.  This second DTIC PE is established to track activities deemed as headquarters functions, with no operational efficiencies or enhancement to mission.\n\nThe new PE supports the following HQ functions and mission essential activities critical to the success of DTIC\u2019s business operations, and mandated by law or regulation: \n\n- Activity leadership, strategic planning, and Front Office support staff.\n-- The front office staff (~ 6 authorizations) represents a small component of this PE.  Most of the specialized functions and skill-sets described below are centralized activities within the PE, yet support the larger organization and its employees.  These activities were consolidated as a means to improve efficiencies throughout DTIC, and are essential to the operation of DTIC\u2019s primary PE 0605801KA.\n-- Reductions to DTIC\u2019s HQ staffing levels continue, reducing civilian full time equivalents (FTEs) below FY 2016 levels. \n- Financial Management and Comptroller.  Provides integrated resource management at the Agency level to obtain, control, and execute budget and manpower authorities to support the organization's mission requirements.  Develops and prepares agency budget documents and exhibits for submission to both OSD and Congress.\n-- Accounting support to DTIC\u2019s mission operations; partners with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to present accurate financial reporting and Fund Balance with Treasury. \n-- Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) activities and oversight in compliance with the Department\u2019s audit goals, objectives, and milestones.\n- Human Resources (HR) Liaison Support.  Provides the DTIC enterprise with payroll processing and \u201cHire to Retire\u201d mission support; oversees and organizes employee training, professional development, and certification programs (e.g., Acquisition, Financial Management, and IT programs).\n-- Coordinates recruitment placement and classification action for the mission areas; liaison to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for HR servicing and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) program maintenance.\n- Mandatory Records Management compliance activities and administration programs.\n- IT Management\/Chief Information Officer (CIO).  Collects, analyzes, and reports information necessary to effectively and efficiently manage enterprise IT resources; CIO functions are performed in compliance with DoD-CIO guidance, instructions and mandates. \n- IT Help Desk\/Local Area Network (LAN).  Office automation supports desktop computing customers; resolves IT-related equipment or system incidents; provides assured system and network availability, info delivery, and secure IT solutions to support current and future business and mission requirements."
