The Vigilant Pursuit System currently consists of 2 vehicles with integrated Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages installed on MATVs. Funding ($3.744M) supports developmental activities to create vehicle-independent and tailorable Multi-INT Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability packages that can be installed and removed in a matter of minutes on any vehicle type to meet specific mission needs. Specific activities include hardware development for several small but critical hardware components that cannot be commercially procured necessary to refactor the Multi-INT capability packages to work on any vehicle platform and software development necessary to replace\/upgrade open source code that is no longer current\/viable and is therefore more difficult and expensive to maintain or completely unusable.  \n\nFunding ($1,210K) supports development & testing of software code integrating new voice matching algorithms to deliver improved technical capabilities of stand-off voice biometric collection & speaker identification within the Voice Identity Biometrics Exploitation System (VIBES) QRC to counter ever-changing threats facing deployed operational forces. The VIBES software program provides a stand-off speaker identification capability that supports operations in OFS and OIR. Software development is necessary for the program to remain current & compliant with enterprise standards; will improve the data flow & efficiency of the system enabling faster response times, increased automation, & tighter integration with existing biometrics and intelligence systems.  \n\nFunding ($2,150K) supports the development of new software code & associated testing necessary to deliver an instance of the Biometric Intelligence Information Repository (BI2R-the unique software-based analytic production system used by NGIC specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for OFS and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) C2S cloud.  The new, more capable software will facilitate automated information exchange with complimentary community programs resident on the IC ITE C2S cloud to support the production of a Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) containing all available IC Biometrics and Identity Intelligence.  There are identified contract vehicles at I2WD that have appropriate scope and option years to execute this funding in FY17 and deliver capabilities within 12 months."
