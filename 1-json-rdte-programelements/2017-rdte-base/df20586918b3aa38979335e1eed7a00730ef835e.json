These tools will provide cutting edge hardware and software, integrated with existing infrastructure and tools to facilitate Active Defensive Cyber operations. Cyber Tool Development will include Big Data Analytics solutions to enable the ability to correlate and analyze the massive amount of data coming across the network and provide timely situational awareness. It will also include development, integration, and testing of Defensive Cyber Tool and Infrastructure that will facilitate pushing Cyber sensor data to the Big Data analytics as well as support remote access to prevent or react to a Cyber incident. The Cyber Tool Development includes test and assessment of emerging Commercial Cyber tools for inclusion in the Defensive Cyber Operations Infrastructure. This tool development will include enhancements and testing of existing systems by enabling such capabilities as Public Key Infrastructure and enhancing mission assurance profiles of existing software that will heighten the Defensive Cyber posture.\n\nThis Program Element will support the Defensive Cyber Operations Infrastructure (DCO-I) program starting in FY17 to integrate and deliver key hardware and software that enables the Cyber Mission Forces to protect, search and discover, maneuver and engage, and mitigate and respond to enemy cyberspace operations. DCO-I will allow near real-time employment of defensive measures that will allow friendly cyber forces to maintain advantage. DCO-I will consist of a combination of hardware computing infrastructure along with advanced software fielded to units from Army Service Component Commands down to Brigade Combat Team level. DCO-I directly supports US Cyber Command Integrated Priority List #2 Produce Advanced Cyberspace Infrastructure and #5 defensive forces to execute passive and active defense operations at net-speed."

The DCO-I capability will primarily use commercial off the shelf (or slightly modified commercial off the shelf) hardware and software integrated with components of the Warfighter Information Network \u2013 Tactical and Mission Command programs. The functionality of DCO-I will integrate with the Command Post Computing Environment to support Commanders from Brigade up to Army Component Command level. Execution of the DCO-I program will be a combination of Government Labs (COMMUNICATIONS-ELECTRONICS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING CENTER) and Contractor support.\n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets,firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited cluster deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access. The Army's DCO activities is a construct of active cyberspace defense which provides synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats and vulnerability to DoD networks and systems."
