This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment\/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on Portfolio Management Decision Support System by capturing and mapping issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk."

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."
