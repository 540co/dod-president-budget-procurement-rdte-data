        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Ballistic Missile Defense Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) Program provides hardware and develops software to link separate sensors and weapons into an integrated, layered missile defense system that provides greater performance and defensive coverage than is possible with stand-alone elements. The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats, including near-simultaneous enemy missiles aimed at theater, regional, or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Aegis Ashore,  Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), and Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS); and sensors such as the Army Navy\/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN\/TPY-2) radar, Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX), Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), and BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). In FY 2015, the C2BMC Program successfully tested and activated a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) in support of a second forward based AN\/TPY-2 in the Pacific Command (PACOM). This capability improves homeland defense against emerging threats from North Korea and provides the Combatant Commander (CCMD) greater flexibility for regional defense in the PACOM Area of Responsibility (AOR).  C2BMC delivered long haul communication upgrades to EUCOM, CENTCOM and PACOM AN\/TPY-2 sites and to the Aegis Ashore site in Romania. The C2BMC Program also delivered the capability to integrate BMDS Middle East and European missile defense capabilities allowing both CCMD to leverage each other's assets.\n\nBased on defined BMDS architectures and system specifications, C2BMC provides the warfighter the capability to plan the BMD fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats, and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range, in all theaters. The C2BMC program will deliver full AN\/TPY-2 X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for improved threat object correlation to develop a common threat track from multiple sensors, with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness to enable successful engagements. The C2BMC program also works to increase coalition partners' capabilities. \n\nThe C2BMC program provides continuous incremental capability upgrades to the Warfighter via software Spirals; therefore, there are necessary overlaps in the fielded and in-development Spirals' activities.  C2BMC structures software Spiral development and support cycles to meet defined fielding dates within the established Ground Test campaign schedules while allowing sufficient time for development and verification and validation test activities.  The fieldings of Spirals are phased to accommodate fiscal and performance priorities, in coordination with Combatant Commanders' intent.  Currently, Spiral 6.4 provides continuous global operations across five Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and supports EPAA Phases 1 and 2.  The next Spiral (Spiral 8.2-1) has completed development and is currently in verification testing in preparation for scheduled fielding in FY 2017. Spiral 8.2-1 will support Enhanced Homeland Defense capability by providing increased GMD battlespace, Link 16 track reporting of additional sensors, enhanced sensor tasking to meet track quality and discrimination timeliness requirements to support GMD engagements, and space situational awareness tasking support. Spiral 8.2-1 will also provide access to the BMDS OPIR assets and upgraded SBIRS sensor data to enable much earlier cueing for radars and shooters.  Spiral 8.2-3 is currently in development and is scheduled for FY 2019 delivery. Spiral 8.2-3 will enable Aegis BMD to provide a five-fold increase in defended area by providing critical sensor management and track reporting improvements for Aegis BMD Engage-on-Remote (EOR) functionality in support of EPAA Phase 3, improve OPIR-based cueing of radars and shooters in all phases of threat engagements, and provide integration with the new Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS). C2BMC is conducting requirements analysis for the future Spiral 8.2-5 which will integrate and control the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) into the BMDS in the 2020 time frame.  C2BMC will perform sensor management of the LRDR and fusion of LRDR sensor data into the C2BMC system tracking capability.  C2BMC will update interfaces to provide appropriate LRDR-based information to the GMD Fire Control (GFC) and other BMDS elements.\n\nC2BMC also provides the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Communications Network (BCN), which connects an expanding set of sensors and weapons systems, to enable the National Command Authority and the strategic, theater, and tactical level commanders to optimally engage ballistic missile threats including near simultaneous theater, regional and homeland attacks.  The BCN provides a robust, end-to-end, high availability, operational communications network infrastructure with diverse paths to rapidly share information across the global Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The C2BMC system and networks are protected from cyber-attacks by layered defenses that start with circuits comprising the BCN that are isolated from the known networks.  Where the BCN and the known networks meet, layers of firewalls, encryption devices, routers and switches each with specific access control lists (ACLs), further protect the internal systems and allow only identified and approved users and systems access to the C2BMC data.  Effective network management will coordinate and integrate across diverse equipment platforms, interface with other DoD communications systems, evolve information standards and capabilities, and adhere to the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF).  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) services are highly leveraged in providing worldwide communications.\n\nThis Program Element includes support for discrimination improvement efforts, which aim to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS effectiveness and resilience against the evolving threat.  The end result will be a BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a re-entry vehicle with a high degree of confidence, improving Warfighter shot doctrine and preserving inventory.  This effort encompasses Near -term, Mid-term, and Far-term discrimination improvements capability fielding.  The discrimination improvements require a coordinated effort between Systems Engineering (PE 0603890C), Ground-based Midcourse Defense (PE 0603882C), BMD Sensors (PE 0603884C), C2BMC, Aegis BMD (PE 0603892C) and Advanced C4ISR (PE 0603179C).    \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

                            "val": "Budget Project MD01 includes a phased progression of RDT&E articles.  Spiral 6.4, was successfully fielded in FY 2011\/FY 2012 in NORTHCOM, PACOM, EUCOM, and CENTCOM to support multi-TPY-2 sensor management, BMDS situational awareness and battle management, and European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) Phase 1 capability declaration.  Spiral 6.4 is also the basis of support to EPAA Phase 2 and near-term discrimination improvements The next spiral (Spiral 8.2-1) has completed development and is currently in verification testing.  This capability is scheduled for FY 2017 fielding.  Spiral 8.2-1 supports Enhanced Homeland Defense capability by providing increased Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) battlespace, Link 16 track reporting of additional sensors, enhanced sensor tasking to meet track quality and discrimination timeliness requirements to support GMD engagements, and space situational awareness tasking support.  Spiral 8.2-1 also provides access to the BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) assets and upgraded Space Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) sensor data to enable much earlier cueing for radars and shooters.  Spiral 8.2-3 is currently in development and is scheduled for an FY 2019 delivery.  This capability will enable Aegis BMD to provide a five-fold increase in defended area by providing critical sensor management and track reporting improvements for Aegis BMD Engage-on-Remote (EOR) functionality in support of EPAA Phase 3, improve OPIR-based cueing of radars and shooters in all phases of threat engagements, and provide integration with the new Army IBCS.  Spiral 8.2-3 supports Presidential mandate EPAA Phase 3 capability declaration by providing critical sensor management and track reporting improvements to Aegis BMD Engage-on-Remote functionality, improves OPIR-based cueing of sensors and shooters in all phases of threat engagements, as well as integration with the new Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS).  Spiral 8.2-5 is in requirements analysis and is scheduled to be fielded in the 2020 timeframe.  Spiral 8.2-5 will integrate and control the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) into the BMDS.  C2BMC will perform sensor management of the LRDR and fusion of LRDR sensor data into the C2BMC system tracking capability.  C2BMC will update interfaces to provide appropriate LRDR-based information to Ground Based Missile Defense (GMD) Fire Control (GFC) and other BMDS elements.\n\nThe discrimination improvements effort will develop and field integrated Element capabilities to improve BMD System ability to identify lethal and non-lethal objects. Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications will complete initial SCOUT development and begin final development and operational integration\/interoperability.  SE&I will perform BMDS performance analysis and requirements engineering activities to specify the BMDS requirements and interfaces to achieve the improved capability.  SE&I will allocate Near-term performance requirements across BMDS elements.  For Mid-term and Far-term, SE&I will establish performance goals for the technology development phase, and develop functional, performance, and interface requirements to address the Mid-term and Far-term threat sets.  SE&I will establish ground and flight test requirements for the Near-term, Mid-term, and Far-term phases, and generate threat data to support analysis and testing activities.\n\nDevelopment of C2BMC capabilities in the functional areas of BMDS planning, situational awareness, sensor management, and engagement coordination are fully traceable to baselined BMDS specifications and associated Element specifications.  Performance outcomes within these functional areas include: \n- Improved  formulation of a common threat track from multiple sensors with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon Elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16\n- Improved Interface with AN\/TPY-2 Forward Based Mode (FBM) to provide greater flexibility in meeting C2BMC and Weapons System needs for Engagement Quality Data supporting Remote Engagements (EOR) with Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)\n- Incorporation of BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture and upgraded Space Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) sensor data to enable much earlier cueing of sensor and shooter, improve threat tracking, and provide source information for discrimination \n- Integration of the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) into the BMDS to provide robust homeland and regional defense\n- Improved BMDS discrimination logic using multiple sensors' discrimination data to identify lethal objects and reduce the number of interceptors required to achieve successful threat engagement \n- Engagement coordination tools to make more efficient use of limited sensor and shooter inventory\n- Enhanced BMD planning and situational awareness to improve placement of BMDS assets and maintain warfighter cognizance of the battle space\n- Delivery of a Distributed Training System to enable Combatant Commands (CCMD) to support large scale exercises and training events  without scheduling downtime of BMDS operations\n- Delivery of the Training Support System to provide a  flexible scenario, small footprint training system for small scale CCMD training events and schoolhouses\n\nDevelopment activities culminate in three key test events:  Simulation-based Verification, Site Activation Testing, and Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)-wide Ground Testing.  Simulation-based verification focuses on integration testing with other Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Elements.  Site Activation Testing and successful participation in BMDS Ground Test campaigns verify delivery of fully functioning operational software, which is then made available for deployment.\n\nC2BMC also provides the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Communications Network (BCN), which connects an expanding set of sensors and weapons systems, to enable the National Command Authority and the strategic, theater, and tactical level commanders to optimally engage ballistic missile threats including near simultaneous theater, regional and homeland attacks.  The BCN provides a robust, end-to-end, high availability, operational communications network infrastructure with diverse paths to rapidly share information across the global Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The C2BMC system and networks are protected from cyber-attacks by layered defenses that start with circuits comprising the BCN that are isolated from the known networks.  Where the BCN and the known networks meet, layers of firewalls, encryption devices, routers and switches each with specific access control lists (ACLs), further protect the internal systems and allow only identified and approved users and systems access to the C2BMC data.  Effective network management will coordinate and integrate across diverse equipment platforms, interface with other DoD communications systems, evolve information standards and capabilities, and adhere to the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF).  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) services are highly leveraged in providing worldwide communications."

Lockheed Martin Mission Systems was the C2BMC prime contractor via an Other Transaction Agreement contract vehicle, which ended 1st quarter FY 2012. A sole source C2BMC follow-on contract to Lockheed Martin for Spiral Development, Operation and Sustainment, and Testing was awarded 1st quarter FY 2012 for an ordering period of five years through 1st quarter FY 2017. Spiral 8.2 will be fielded in three separate increments.   Spiral 8.2-1 will be fielded in FY 2017, fielding of Spiral 8.2-3 in FY 2019, and completion of system deployment with Spiral 8.2-5 in FY 2021.  This incremental fielding required a modification to the base contract increasing the ceiling by $870 million and adding an additional five-year ordering period to extend the contract through first quarter FY 2022.  Major team members to Lockheed are Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They are charged with the development, testing, fielding, training, and operations and sustainment support of the C2BMC system. They perform development and testing of C2BMC products in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; and Colorado Springs, CO; and provide worldwide on-site operations and maintenance support. Additionally, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) supports C2BMC worldwide long-haul communications. C2BMC Program Office government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC), and Contract Support Services (CSS) personnel are also fully integrated as part of the Prime contractor`s team to function in an Integrated Product Team environment."

Lockheed Martin Mission Systems was the C2BMC prime contractor via an Other Transaction Agreement contract vehicle, which ended 1st quarter FY 2012. A sole source C2BMC follow-on contract to Lockheed Martin for Spiral Development, Operation and Sustainment, and Testing was awarded 1st quarter FY 2012 for an ordering period of five years through 1st quarter FY 2017. Spiral 8.2 will be fielded in three separate increments.   Spiral 8.2-1 will be fielded in FY 2017, fielding of Spiral 8.2-3 in FY 2019, and completion of system deployment with Spiral 8.2-5 in FY 2021.  This incremental fielding required a modification to the base contract increasing the ceiling by $870 million and adding an additional five-year ordering period to extend the contract through first quarter FY 2022.  Major team members to Lockheed are Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They are charged with the development, testing, fielding, training, and operations and sustainment support of the C2BMC system. They perform development and testing of C2BMC products in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; and Colorado Springs, CO; and provide worldwide on-site operations and maintenance support. Additionally, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) supports C2BMC worldwide long-haul communications. C2BMC Program Office government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC), and Contract Support Services (CSS) personnel are also fully integrated as part of the Prime contractor`s team to function in an Integrated Product Team environment."

Lockheed Martin Mission Systems was the C2BMC prime contractor via an Other Transaction Agreement contract vehicle, which ended 1st quarter FY 2012. A sole source C2BMC follow-on contract to Lockheed Martin for Spiral Development, Operation and Sustainment, and Testing was awarded 1st quarter FY 2012 for an ordering period of five years through 1st quarter FY 2017. Spiral 8.2 will be fielded in three separate increments.   Spiral 8.2-1 will be fielded in FY 2017, fielding of Spiral 8.2-3 in FY 2019, and completion of system deployment with Spiral 8.2-5 in FY 2021.  This incremental fielding required a modification to the base contract increasing the ceiling by $870 million and adding an additional five-year ordering period to extend the contract through first quarter FY 2022.  Major team members to Lockheed are Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They are charged with the development, testing, fielding, training, and operations and sustainment support of the C2BMC system. They perform development and testing of C2BMC products in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; and Colorado Springs, CO; and provide worldwide on-site operations and maintenance support. Additionally, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) supports C2BMC worldwide long-haul communications. C2BMC Program Office government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC), and Contract Support Services (CSS) personnel are also fully integrated as part of the Prime contractor`s team to function in an Integrated Product Team environment."

Lockheed Martin Mission Systems was the C2BMC prime contractor via an Other Transaction Agreement contract vehicle, which ended 1st quarter FY 2012. A sole source C2BMC follow-on contract to Lockheed Martin for Spiral Development, Operation and Sustainment, and Testing was awarded 1st quarter FY 2012 for an ordering period of five years through 1st quarter FY 2017. Spiral 8.2 will be fielded in three separate increments.   Spiral 8.2-1 will be fielded in FY 2017, fielding of Spiral 8.2-3 in FY 2019, and completion of system deployment with Spiral 8.2-5 in FY 2021.  This incremental fielding required a modification to the base contract increasing the ceiling by $870 million and adding an additional five-year ordering period to extend the contract through first quarter FY 2022.  Major team members to Lockheed are Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They are charged with the development, testing, fielding, training, and operations and sustainment support of the C2BMC system. They perform development and testing of C2BMC products in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; and Colorado Springs, CO; and provide worldwide on-site operations and maintenance support. Additionally, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) supports C2BMC worldwide long-haul communications. C2BMC Program Office government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC\/UARC), and Contract Support Services (CSS) personnel are also fully integrated as part of the Prime contractor`s team to function in an Integrated Product Team environment."
