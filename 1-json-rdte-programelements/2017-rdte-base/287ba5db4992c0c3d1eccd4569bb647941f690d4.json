            "val": "This program develops propulsion and power technologies to achieve enabling and revolutionary aerospace technology capabilities. The program has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The Advanced Propulsion Technology project develops high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Combustion and Mechanical Systems project develops engine mechanical system technologies: bearings, seals, drives, and lubricants as well as combustion components, concepts, and technologies for legacy and advanced turbine engines.  The Turbine Engine Technology project develops enabling capabilities to enhance performance and affordability of existing weapon systems and develops component technologies for ultra high pressure ratio, substantially improved durability, and adaptive cycle engine architecture to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and life for widely varying mission needs. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops electrical power and thermal management technologies for military applications that remove operational limitations and enable advanced vehicle designs and high-power mission systems. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include:  lubricants, bearings, mechanical systems diagnostics, mechanical systems prognostics, rotor dynamics, oil-less engine technology, optical diagnostics, fundamental combustion, detonations, combustors, and afterburners. Lubricants for these engines must be thermally stable, cost-effective, and operate over a broad range of conditions. Advanced combustion concepts must be cost-effective, durable, and reduce pollutant emissions. A portion of this project supports adaptive cycle technologies. This effort develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides both optimized performance and fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire DoD. Technologies under this program enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Efforts include:  modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance efforts could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All efforts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program and reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and achieve RP21 Goals."
