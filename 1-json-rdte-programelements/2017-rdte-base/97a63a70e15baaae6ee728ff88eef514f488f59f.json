            "val": "On 15 March 2013, the Secretary of Defense announced steps to bolster protection of the homeland and stay ahead of the evolving quantity and complexity of long range ballistic missile threats.  These steps included adding Ground-Based Interceptors and shifting resources to develop advanced kill vehicle technology to improve all ballistic missile defense interceptors that operate outside the earth's atmosphere.  The successful first phase of the Common Kill Vehicle Technology effort defined concepts for the redesign of the ground based interceptor Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle.  This effort completed advanced technology development and transitioned to the redesigned kill vehicle effort in FY 2014.  \n\nThe next phase of the Common Kill Vehicle Technology effort will enhance Ballistic Missile Defense System interceptor performance by improving discrimination and adding the capability to destroy several objects within a threat complex using multiple kill vehicles carried on a single interceptor.  MDA is developing the concepts for a MOKV based on a modular, open architecture designed to common interfaces and standards, making upgrades easier and broadening MDA's vendor and supplier base.  The Agency will focus on the competitive development of MOKV concepts with industry in FY 2015-2016.\n\nThis capability relies on a BMDS architecture that balances performance across the sensor, Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications, and kill vehicle elements. The Agency anticipates deploying this capability across the interceptor fleet in the next decade to address the evolving threat. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

The concepts informed the Agency's development of system requirements and served as the foundation for product development of the Re-designed Kill Vehicle. \nIn FY 2015, the Agency awarded several contracts with industry to define concepts for a Multi-Object Kill Vehicle (MOKV) based on this open architecture.  The Agency's focus in FY 2016 is to develop government and industry concepts for a MOKV as a second phase of the common kill vehicle technology effort.  A key element is the requirement for industry to comply with a modular, open architecture with common standards and interfaces defined by the government.  These requirements make future upgrades easier and broaden our vendor and supplier base.  The Government will develop MOKV system engineering guidelines from the industry concept(s), government analysis, modeling, and simulation along with hardware-in-the-loop prototype concept demonstration(s).  The kill vehicle hardware-in-the-loop prototype concept(s) and identified technologies will formulate the trade space across cost, risk, and kill vehicle performance to establish requirements that are feasible and affordable for the engineering, manufacturing and development of a future MOKV.\n\nThe effectiveness of the BMDS relies on balancing performance requirements across the elements in the architecture.  For example, the goal of the sensor portion of the architecture is to detect, acquire, track and discriminate lethal object(s), deployment debris, and countermeasures.  \n\nAnalysis shows that having multiple kill vehicles on each interceptor dramatically improves the performance of the system, while maximizing the use of the interceptor inventory, and reducing our cost to defend the Homeland.\n\nThe Agency's past efforts on multiple kill vehicle research showed that the most difficult technical challenge for Multiple Kill Vehicles was managing the many-on-many engagements that occur.  In FY 2016, MDA will resume tackling this challenge by investigating the engagement management concepts authored by industry as well as our government concepts.  MDA will test these algorithms and strategy using our hardware-in-the-loop, and invest in key technologies that will enable a MOKV concept including kill vehicle-to-kill vehicle communications, and a more accurate and lighter weight inertial measurement unit. \n\nThe MOKV industry prototype concept(s) will identify and reduce development risk; identify technology readiness; and demonstrate critical technical features and capabilities.  The Agency will use industry concept models to assess MOKV performance and the utility of the MOKV architecture.  The prototype demonstration will validate the industry concept models for higher confidence and prove the viability of the MOKV.  These results will inform Agency requirements development efforts that may support a future milestone decision. \n\nAccurate and reliable inertial measurement units are essential for navigation during the long kill vehicle flight times required to engage Intercontinental ballistic missile threats.  MOKV investments will develop precise, small, lightweight, highly reliable, and low cost inertial measurement unit s to increase kill vehicle performance for long flight times.  Continued investment will satisfy the inertial measurement unit performance needed for the small, high performance kill vehicle concepts that can defeat future interceptor threats.  This inertial measurement unit will demonstrate improved performance over current state of the art by reducing navigation error.  The initial hardware inertial measurement unit prototype will demonstrate reduced size, weight and power requirements.\n\nHigh band width kill vehicle-to-kill vehicle and kill vehicle-to-ground communications will enable engagement management for Multi-Object Kill Vehicle (MOKV) architecture.  MOKV investments will focus on minimizing size, weight and power of a software defined radio that provides flexible communication capabilities that are robust and reliable.  Design and development efforts of this communications technology in 2016 will lead to a future prototype demonstration of high band-width communications using software defined radio technology."
