To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective\/efficient\/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations\/analytics, distribution demand forecasting\/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities. Current planning\/forecasting\/collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays\/changes and conduct \"what -if\" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations."
