            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.\n\nFY 2017 core funding of $.998 million for CCTT enables gaming technology and visualization for maneuver training, and the P3I for the CCTT, to include virtualization and other Better Buying Power initiatives in order to reduce life cycle costs.\n\nFY 2017 base funding of $1.979 million for Games for Training will provide for modifications to the Games for Training (GFT) system to ensure compliance with the Live, Virtual, Constructive\/Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) in support of Force 2025 and Beyond. It will also integrate new commercial and Government technology products into the current gaming system. \n\nFY 2017 base funding of $9.322 million will continue the efforts of providing development of the capability to produce common terrain databases to maintain concurrency with supported training systems. FY 2017 funds will continue modifying the Terrain Development process for constructive terrain databases, and continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture. Base funding also provides continuous development of new OneSAF capabilities for virtual simulations and enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE); this is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs). SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop\ncommon visual models and transportation networks. FY17 base funding request decreased significantly from the PB16 submission due to a de-scoping of program requirements.\n  \nFY 2017 base funding of $2.769 million will complete the design, development, and testing for the first article test for a virtualized AVCATT manned module architecture in order to reduce the current computer hardware footprint in preparation for FY18 planned hardware modernization."

The GFT program satisfies the Active, the National Guard, and the Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo-specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. GFT comprehensively trains Company and below formations to operate in today's dynamic combat environment. GFT trains higher multi-echelon units and staffs without troops to meet Combatant Commanders\u2019 requirements.  \n\nFY 2017 base funding of $1.979 million will continue the integration of the GFT flagship product into the Live, Virtual, Constructive\/Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE). Additionally, base funding will also fund market research for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of GFT increment II."

SE Core's mission is to ensure the Army's training systems and simulators are integrated and interoperable in support of U.S. Army Readiness. SE Core provides virtual simulators with visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Force 2025 and beyond.  The result is a \"Fair Fight\" capability; no simulator or operator will have an inherent advantage over another.  Fair Fight allows for air and ground to have coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations.  Additionally, SE Core is building the Army's Common Virtual Environment (CVE) that provides the linkage between simulators and establishes a common environment for interoperability, allowing various simulators to be linked together for a train-as-we-fight capability. SE Core is a foundational element in the Integrated Training Environment linking the embedded systems, multi-mode Live, Virtual, Constructive, Gaming (LVCG) training capability with current systems.\n\nThe SE Core components are Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) integration; terrain database production; common visual models; virtual systems architecture; a dynamic environment; and mission command development.  A major SE Core component is the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) process used to produce the synthetic terrain used in simulators and simulations.  This terrain is a key component for virtual simulators and constructive simulations and will meet the demands of today's and future simulations.  \n\nFY 2017 base funding of $9.322 million will continue the efforts of providing development of the capability to produce common terrain databases to maintain concurrency with supported training systems.  FY 2017 funds will continue modifying the Terrain Development process for constructive terrain databases, and continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture. Base funding also provides continuous development of new OneSAF capabilities for virtual simulations and enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE); this is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs).  SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks. \n\nFY17 base funding request decreased significantly from the PB16 submission due to a de-scoping of program requirements."

The SE Core program is developing the software tools and processes to develop the Army's common virtual environment to link simulation devices (to include: CCTT, AVCATT, GFT, LVC-IA, HITS, JLCCTC, FIRESIM, OneSAF) into an interoperable environment and maintaining the synthetic terrain, models, and virtual OneSAF for the Army's Integrated Training Environment (ITE) concept. \n\nThe government awarded Increment 2 as a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Leidos in August 2011 with a period of performance start date of December 2011. Leidos was formerly known as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  This contract has a one-year base with four one-year options.  The government exercised the first option in December 2012, the second option in December 2013, the third option in December 2014 and the fourth option in December 2015.

The most recently awarded fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, includes options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.\n\nAVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals."
