AWG request is not reflected in funding figures.\n\nThe Rapid Equipping Force (REF) supports Combatant Command (COCOM)\/Army Service Component Command (ASCC) based on emerging rapid equipment requirements.   The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), signed by the Under Secretary of the Army:  Joseph W. Westphal, dated 30 January 2014. \n\nThe REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and ASCCs to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to U.S. Army Forces employed globally.  The REF is the Army's quick reaction capability with the ability to develop, prototype, acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for forces employed globally.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.  \n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years.  The REF coordinates in theater work with the ASCC of the COCOMs to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  This fiscal flexibility is significant in that it permits the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  \n\nThe REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, but focuses on Brigade level and below to find solutions to identified capability gaps.  These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military\/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a future force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  \n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the needs of Soldiers serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).   This establishes a formal acquisition - reporting chain that leverages - existing reporting venues, to ensure appropriate ASA (ALT) visibility, oversight, and direction.  \n\nThe REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Function Areas:\n1 \u2013 Mission Command\n2 \u2013 Movement and Maneuver\n3 \u2013 Intelligence \n4 \u2013 Fires\n5 \u2013 Sustainment\n6 \u2013 Protection \n\nThe REF FY17 RDT&E request $3.259 million (Base) is for system integration, testing and evaluation to support project requirements. \n  \nThe RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions.  RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for REF provided non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the unit.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that the equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are known and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different COTS\/GOTS\/NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&E funds are used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  The REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, but now may be suitable to solve another problem.   REF will fund deliberate projects in support of technology solution scouting to meet anticipated needs.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies and provide capability assessments to TRADOC and other organizations with the intent of informing future requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Nano Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Assessment; Carbine Optics; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat System, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR); Small Unit Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR); Electronic Warfare; Counter Unmanned Aerial System (UAS); Operational Energy; Mission Command; and Force Protection.\n\n\nMission Description AWG:  The Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) provides critical operational advisory support globally and rapid solution development to Army and Joint Force Commanders to enhance Soldier survivability and combat effectiveness, continuously assesses the Operating Environment (OE), to defeat current and emerging threats.  As such, AWG is uniquely positioned to quickly provide feedback and observations of asymmetric threats back to TRADOC Centers and Schools allowing for the timely adaptation of training, Programs of Instruction and informing capability requirements of future forces.  \n\nWith its theater access, AWG continues to serve in its advisory capacity to assist regionally aligned forces (RAF), support ASCC security cooperation missions, as well as inform Army innovation programs. In times of crisis, the AWG will continue to be a critical combat enabler to Army and Joint contingency force deployments responding to a diverse range of theater threats and requirements."

During the same period, the REF expects to see an increase in requirements submitted by Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) in other areas of the world, as well as, from brigades employed in more global roles, such as the regionally aligned BCTs, and their logistical support elements.  The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  \n\nFor FY16 the REF projected 664 requirements (101 Base, 563 OCO).   The projection was based on the requirements demand signal and modified using the following planning assumptions:\n\n1) Based on expanding Army operations worldwide we anticipate significant requirements from deployed Army forces in non-OCO regions.\n2) There is no change in the OMB OCO criteria and guidance,\n3) The number of troops deployed to Afghanistan\/OFS (~10K) and the types of missions they are performing remains constant through June 2016 then maybe reduced by 50% for the remainder of the year,\n4) The number of troops deployed to Iraq\/OIR (~4K) and the types of missions they are performing remains unchanged, \n5) And, there is no significant change in the level of operational support to Counter-ISL operations outside of Iraq.\n\nA change to any of these assumptions could have significant impact on the number and type of requirements received, and upon the type of funding (OCO or Base) required.  For example, any change in OCO guidance could significantly change the ratio of OCO to Base funding required.  Likewise, if troops deployed to OIR are given the mission to accompany Iraqi Security Forces during the anticipated counter-offensive REF could expect a significant increase in Warfighting function requirements for mission command, intelligence, movement and maneuver, and force protection.  In OFS, a decision to retain current manning levels may similarly effect the number of requirements REF receives in FY16."

The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of OIR and other operations in the CENTCOM AOR requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to increase our engagement with the ASCCs in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations.   The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Global Response Force as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  We anticipate increased coordination with various Army technology demonstrations and Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstrations in order to leverage developed residual technologies to rapidly address identified critical capability gaps and gain immediate feedback through limited user evaluations.   In accordance with REF\u2019s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army\u2019s warm base capability with ~100 requirements in FY17 and beyond.\n\nFor FY17 the REF projects ~100 requirements in the following REF Warfighter function areas.\n\n1 \u2013 Mission Command (344K)\n2 \u2013 Movement and Maneuver (782K)\n3 \u2013 Intelligence  (254K)\n4 \u2013 Fires  (34K)\n5 \u2013 Sustainment (333K)\n6 \u2013 Protection  (512K)\n\nThe REF anticipates ATEC testing and evaluation cost of $1.000 million.

AWG supports solution development and equipping efforts with operational advising\/global first hand observation, but does not conduct materiel acquisition without an appropriate acquisition partner; investment funding is required to legally execute the breadth of AWG\u2019s solution development mission. The use of investment fund is kept to a minimum to accomplish proof of concept and threat replication IOT influence the Army\u2019s capacity to adapt to the evolving threat while informing subsequent TRADOC DOTMLPF-P integration.  AWG will focus efforts to investigate, evaluate, and quantify various Commercial-Off-The-Shelf \/Government-Off-The-Shelf platforms and systems for purposes of research and development, testing, capability and limitation experimenting, and procurement for solutions to emerging capability gaps.  These efforts will focus on near term, leveraging existing technology, and addressing identified capability gaps for emerging research shortfalls, PIPs, leap ahead technologies, and fixes to existing shortfalls (reliability, sustainability, and durability).  \n\nThe AWG RDTE Base request for FY17 is $250K.
