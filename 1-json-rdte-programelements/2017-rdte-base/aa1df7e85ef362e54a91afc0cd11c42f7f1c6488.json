As such, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize those space related capabilities.  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and the Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army Force Modernization proponent for Space and High Altitude Capabilities.\n\nProject 990 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities. Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners.  The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the COP for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT)."

Represent Army positions and defend Army equities relative in Joint\/DoD and inter-Service activities; e.g., Executive Agent for Space Program Assessments, etc.  Will plan and execute wargames to evaluate emerging concepts within the space and high altitude domains as well as participate and provide support to Army and Joint wargames and experiments where space and high altitude capabilities and technologies can be integrated and evaluated in the most realistic operating environment possible.  This is necessary to ensure that space, high altitude and cyber capability gaps are identified and capabilities are correctly represented so that the Army's use of these capabilities is explored and where possible, exploited.  Will develop and maintain One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) simulation space updates and provide to PEO STRI to be included in OneSAF baseline.  Will develop space modernization strategies and sponsor exploration of future space and high altitude warfighting concepts.  USASMDC\/ARSTRAT will continue efforts to enhance the resiliency and effectiveness of critical space-based assets and JCIDS capability development activities for space superiority, high altitude persistent platforms, nano-satellites and tactical launch systems. Products scheduled to be delivered in FY17 include Army Cyberspace Analysis; Space Superiority Analysis of Alternatives and Cost -Benefit Analysis updates: Overhead Persistence Infrared (OPIR) Analysis; Assessment of Hostile use of Space Force Enhancement; and Position Navigation Timing (PNT) analysis.  TAA 20-24 (APR 2016-MAR 2017) will introduce new space capabilities into the force.  In order to bring those capabilities into the force development of new force design updates (FDUs) for FDU cycles 16-1, 16-2, 17-1 will be required.  Additionally during the TAA cycle new Rules of Allocation (ROA) will be developed to ensure SRC40 units are properly accounted for in the future POM force."
