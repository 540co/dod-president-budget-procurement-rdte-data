To this end, ACS is challenged to provide lighter, leaner, rapidly-deployable and technologically-advanced materiel and forces; timelier planning and execution capabilities; and more agile, responsive, and efficient sustainment capabilities to the warfighter. Current projects in this program provide Civil Engineering Readiness (Project 652895) and Aeromedical Readiness (Project 654910). Civil Engineering Readiness projects enable rapid deployment, defense, and sustainment of airfield operations within established timelines anywhere in the world. Aeromedical Readiness projects provide aerospace medical systems and treatment equipment to meet unique, worldwide warfighter medical operational requirements.   \n\nThe FY2017 funding request was reduced by $10.740 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nBA 5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
