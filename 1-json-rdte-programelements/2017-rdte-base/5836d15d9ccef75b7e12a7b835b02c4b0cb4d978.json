The employment of this system interdicts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the fielding of the Baseline 2 (BL2) configuration and the mid-Baseline 2 (MBL2) enhancements.  BL2 configuration and MBL2 enhancements currently being fielded have advanced the COMPASS CALL's electronic attack capabilities significantly over the two previously fielded baselines (BL0 and BL1).  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies. Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS #1 and CCMCS #2) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) mirrors the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well to ensure training requirements provide the worldwide operational proficiency needed to comply with continually evolving CNS\/ATM and RNP enhancements, parameters, and guidance.\n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds. Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the third generation of Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (a.k.a. glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware, firmware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  \n\nFY 2017 RDT&E efforts will concentrate support for Baseline 3(BL3)\/platform upgrades to the COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems\/simulators.  The programmed BL3 upgrades will advance the primary mission equipment (PME) even further as the 2017 development efforts address the evolving electronic attack requirement for the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)\/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI)are addressed with each baseline upgrade\/enhancement as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.\n\nActivities in the FY 2017 RDT&E efforts also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nDue to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development  because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
