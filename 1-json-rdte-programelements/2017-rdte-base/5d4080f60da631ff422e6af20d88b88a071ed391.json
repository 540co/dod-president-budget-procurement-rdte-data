AITS-JPO supports preparing for future joint force and coalition initiatives through developing and integrating a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support cooperative activities between the US and its coalition partners. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  \n\nThe program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements: (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)\/Combatant Commands (COCOMs)\/Services\/Agency; (2) Joint Ventures with COCOMs\/Program of Record (POR); and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR\/Community of Interest. The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs. OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  Defense Information Systems Agency participates in both a technical and transition manager role.  The JCTDs and the Joint Ventures and risk mitigation pilots use a teaming approach thereby sharing costs and reducing the risk to individual organizations."

This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority\/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor\/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts. CTO reviews existing contract vehicles and the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of individual contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA."
