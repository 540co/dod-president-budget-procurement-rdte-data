The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\nThe MDA's SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 16 Research Areas for the following key components:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): Develops Naval BMD Capability \n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the non-Aegis portfolio including Targets, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Ground-based Midcourse Defense, and the Israeli programs\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter\n-Advanced Technology: Develops technology to counter future threats \n\nSBIR and STTR topic areas for FY 2015 included: \n- Advanced Cognition Processing and Algorithms for Improved Identification\n- Kinematic Reach\/Containment\n- System Communications\n- Lethality Enhancement\n- Gaming Trainer\n- Command and Control Human-to-Machine Interface\n- Improved Track Accuracy for Missile Engagements\n- Innovative Methodologies for Modeling Fracture Under High Strain-rate Loading\n- Thermally Efficient Emitter Technology for Advanced Scene\/Simulation Capability in Hardware in the Loop Testing \n- Innovative Antenna Arrays Enabling Continuous Interceptor Communications\n- Multi-Object Payload Deployment\n- Interceptor Thermal Protection Systems\n- Low Light Short Wave Infrared Focal Plane Arrays\n- Solid State High Power Amplifier for Communications\n- Non-Destructive Testing Methods for Detecting Red Plague Within an Insulated Silver Plated Copper Conductor\n- Passive Inter-Modulation RF Emissions Utilized for Identifying Galvanic Corrosion in Metal Structures\n- Contextual Reasoning for Object Identification\n- System of Systems Control Interactions\n- Aerospace Vehicle Signature Modeling Technologies\n- Spectral Crosstalk Reduction for Dual-band Long Wave Infrared Detectors\n- Gold Contaminated Solder Joint Characterization for Quantifying Risks Associated with Gold Embrittlement\n- Open Framework Planner with Embedded Training\n- Irrefutable Tamper Evidence\n- Self-Building\/Establishing Networks\n- Inline Threat Generation for Modeling and Simulation\n- Innovative Ways to Shorten System Level Simulation Integration Time\n- High Power Fiber Laser Tap Couplers for Phase and Polarization Control\n- General Wave-Optics Based Scaling Laws for Multiple\/Obscured Apertures\n- Smart Readout Integrated Circuit for Dual Band Infrared Focal Plane Arrays\n- Advanced Reserve Battery Technologies\n- MEMS IMU Solutions for Missile Defense Applications\n- Lithium Oxyhalide Battery Separator Material"

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\nThe MDA's SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 16 Research Areas for the following key components:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): Develops Naval BMD Capability \n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the non-Aegis portfolio including Targets, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Ground-based Midcourse Defense, and the Israeli programs\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter\n-Advanced Technology: Develops technology to counter future threats"
