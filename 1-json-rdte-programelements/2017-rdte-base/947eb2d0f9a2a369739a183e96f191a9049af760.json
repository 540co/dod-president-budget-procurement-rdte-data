In FY17-19, this funding will also integrate newly developed filtration material into existing M98 filter sets.  These new filters will provide the Warfighter with improved protection against toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials while maintaining performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents and meeting military standards.  Additionally, these improvements can serve a dual purpose by providing improvements to other Collective Protection Systems such as the Chemical and Biological Protective Shelter, Shipboard Collective Protection Systems, Fixed Site Collective Protection Systems, M20A1 Simplified Collective Protection Equipment, and the Collectively Protected Field Hospitals."

After MS B, awarded competitive Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Science Applications International Corporation (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test & Evaluation (MOT&E) events.  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) option was awarded to Leidos in January 2014 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  A post MS C Milestone Decision Authority Acquisition Decision Memorandum, dated March 2014, separated the program into two phases.  Phase two systems will be developed as engineering changes to phase one systems.  A business case analysis (BCA) will be conducted to determine the best strategy for full rate production.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for phase one systems implement recommendations from the BCA.  Phase two systems will undergo limited developmental and operational testing and then pursue a MS C full rate production decision.  BA7 funding develops incremental improvements to fielded systems."

The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system\/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system \"mission proven\" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level."

This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nJEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The \"IT Box\" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  \"Agile Software Development\", a term used frequently through the JPM IS R forms, is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development.  \n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  \n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity\/Information Assurance (CS\/IA),Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.

The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.\n\nAs part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy was successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. \n\nThe current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document.  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY17 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY17 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.\n\nThe JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among five separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was approved in June of 2014.  Since last report, the numbering scheme for RDPs was rearranged to account for the sequence of approval for each RDP.  RDP-2 now defines requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-2.  RDP-2 will be released following RDP-1 to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-3 is a notional package that allows the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&T and analytical use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology and analytical communities and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-3.  Capabilities in RDP-3 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users.  RDP-4 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that have reached a sufficient maturity for incorporation into the operationally fielded JEM system, such as ability to model new agents.  RDP-5 was added as a mechanism to define requirements for JEM 2.0 through the remainder of its life cycle.\n\nRDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1. \nRDP 2 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems\nRDP 3 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3.\nRDP 4 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.\nRDP 5 - Modernization and Sustainment: There are 2 Capability Drops (CD) planned per year through the life of the program.\n\nAn over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in September 2014.  Each subsequent RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services."

By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 focused on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays as well as initiating laptop retrofit and fielding.  JBAIDS efforts in FY16 will focus on completing the laptop fielding and continue to develop pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages annually for FDA review.  JBAIDS efforts in FY17 will focus on sustainment and additional pre-EUA's.  This project will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence.\n\n\nThe NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  BA7 will be used to complete the development of assays initiated during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase and needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as fund the development of three objective assays (Burkholderia, Alpha Virus, and Orthopox)."

JBAIDS also has pre-positioned Emergency Use Authorizations assays for the identification of low probability, high consequence pathogens in clinical samples that can be deployed in the event of a declared health emergency.  The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  The JBAIDS program will begin to prepare for the Risk Management Framework processes for FY16 information assurance.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe NGDS Increment 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.\n\nNGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.\n\nThe MB7 program will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding."
