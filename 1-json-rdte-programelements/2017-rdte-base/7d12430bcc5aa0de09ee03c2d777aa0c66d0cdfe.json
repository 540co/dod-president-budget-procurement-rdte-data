            "val": "There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  This program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., vehicles or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site\/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the Army environmental quality technology pillars (military materials in the environment, sustainable ranges and lands, compliance, and pollution prevention).  All work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., \"technology is heading for user to implement\")."

The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment.  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nOur broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at our installations.  The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community."

The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by the NDCEE Technical Working Group (TWG) that includes senior level staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The NDCEE TWG coordinates all NDCEE activities, votes on proposed joint NDCEE projects, and reports back to the EAB Principals.  Working at the tactical levels, three Focus Groups (evironment, safety\/occupational health, and energy) were established to develop joint projects.  The Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program participating in the the Focus Groups also assists in the formulation of suggested environmental technology projects to be demonstrated within the NDCEE Program.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative \"shop floor\".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) when applicable Congressionally directed and funded tasks."

The project increases operational sustainment and warfighter training capabilities by reducing soldier and worker health risks and environmental quality impacts that would otherwise result in restoration needs and compliance enforcement actions against installations while simultaneously increasing performance and standardization across the Army.  The project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data.  Materials and processes demonstrated under this project are inherently more sustainable than the baseline with respect to environmental, safety and occupational health concerns, thereby reducing life cycle costs incurred by acquisition, industrial base and installation end users."
