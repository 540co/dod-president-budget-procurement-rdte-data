The Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.

The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack\/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics\/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air\/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities."
