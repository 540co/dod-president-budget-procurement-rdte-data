Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

A family of affordable lightweight materials is being developed, including metals, polymers, ceramics, metallic and nonmetallic composites, and hybrid materials to provide upgraded capabilities for existing aircraft, missile, and propulsion systems to meet the future system requirements. The project develops high-temperature turbine engine materials that will enable engine designs to double the turbine engine thrust-to-weight ratio. Advanced high temperature protection materials are being developed that are affordable, lightweight, dimensionally stable, thermally conductive, and\/or ablation and erosion resistant to meet aerospace and missile requirements. Alternative or replacement materials are being developed to maintain the performance of aging operational systems. Materials for thermal management including coolants, adaptive thermally conductive materials, coatings, friction and wear-resistant materials, and other pervasive nonstructural materials technologies are being developed for directed energy, propulsion, and subsystems on aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles. The project concurrently develops advanced processing methods to enable adaptive processing of aerospace materials."

Materials for protection of aircrews, sensors, and aircraft from laser, high-power microwave directed energy threats are also developed.  Electronic and optical materials are being developed to enable surveillance and situational awareness with faster operating speeds, greater tunability, higher power output, improved thermal management (including higher operating temperatures), greater sensitivity, and extended dynamic range.  New materials are being developed to counter the most prominent laser threats and to respond to emerging and agile threat wavelengths without impairing mission effectiveness. The project develops nanostructured and biological materials for aircraft structures, munitions, air vehicle subsystems, and personnel. The project develops novel materials for electromagnetic interactions with matter for electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, and lightning strike protection."
