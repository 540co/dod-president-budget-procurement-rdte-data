Project 002 demonstrates tools and methods for compliance with environmental laws relevant to conservation of natural and cultural resources while providing a flexible realistic training environment for mission activities. Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. Project 03E focuses on maturation and demonstration of technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique toxic or hazardous materials. This program demonstrates technological feasibility and transitions mature technologies from the laboratory to the user. Technologies matured and demonstrated by this program element improve the ability of the Army to achieve environmental restoration and compliance at its installations, at active or inactive ranges and other training lands, and in modernization programs. Technologies demonstrated focus on reducing current and future environmental liability costs.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nThis program is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Efforts under this project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, local, and host country environmental regulations and policy. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, assess, and sustain training and testing capacity; power and water management in contingency operations and on installations; and noise mitigation and management. Technologies demonstrated aim to reduce the cost of resolving compliance issues for the Army, avoid reductions in availability of training facilities, and sustain the viability of testing and training ranges as well as protect the critical resources, i.e., land, air, and waters of the Army.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

The emphasis of this effort includes remediation of legacy materials, e.g., traditional explosives energetics, and unexploded ordinance; management of new materials, e.g., nanomaterials and emerging contaminants; and mitigation of residual impacts from implementation of sustainable technologies and processes. Technologies matured within this project enable the Army to cost effectively address current and future environmental liabilities resulting from the use of militarily relevant materials and chemicals in the environment. Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, assess, and remediate soil and water at installations, ranges, facilities, and during operations under changing weather and climatic conditions. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with the myriad of federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. This program includes pilot scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of the risk mitigation techniques.  \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."
