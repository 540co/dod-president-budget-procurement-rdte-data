Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing, and electronics.   It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume\/gun flash detection. This project also investigates and improves III-V materials, semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from Groups III and V of the periodic table. In addition, this project develops algorithms for multispectral and hyperspectral functionality, which provide the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets.  The reduction of size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and 2016 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological advantage in IR sensors for the United States. \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Program Element (PE) is performed by the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."
