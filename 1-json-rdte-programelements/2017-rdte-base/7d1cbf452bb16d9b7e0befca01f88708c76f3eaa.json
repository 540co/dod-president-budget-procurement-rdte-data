            "val": "The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority), correct service revealed deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability & maintainability (R&M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  \n\nHistorically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their life cycle.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives. New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types\/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational. Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines. Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs."

It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability & Maintainability (R&M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion system throughout its service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for field problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type\/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory operational.  F135 CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  F135 CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when the manufacturer incorporate F135 CIP improvements into production.  F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related F135 CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&M and spares costs."
