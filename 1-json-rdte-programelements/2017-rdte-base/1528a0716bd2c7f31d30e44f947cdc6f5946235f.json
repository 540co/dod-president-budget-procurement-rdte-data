These simulator development efforts provide realistic Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation environments to test EW systems and defensive tactics. These projects develop threat Anti-Air and Anti-Ship weapon system simulators in accordance with the Services' requirements.\n\nThe 0602 Project, Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation, directly supports the Test and Evaluation resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, ALQ-144A, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&E.  SIMDIS has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&E and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), OT&E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&E support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP),  Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."
