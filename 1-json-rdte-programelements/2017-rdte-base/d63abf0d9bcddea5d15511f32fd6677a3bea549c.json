            "val": "This Program Element (PE) investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations. This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs\/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization, and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology) and PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism, Technology Development).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed, or performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Research includes methods for radical, effective sensor systems and materials to 'tag' features, items and people of interest; these capabilities are based upon novel and emerging light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor systems and an array of other sensor systems for intermittent and persistent optimal data collection, object identification, and classification for ground operations.

This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated with local communities.      \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver, and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This effort investigates technologies to protect facility indoor air quality from contaminants such as mold, bacteria, and viruses in work and living spaces, as well as develops methods to optimize sustainable operations and maintenance to minimize lifecycle costs. In addition, technologies from this work matures a better understanding of critical infrastructure interdependencies to support sustainable and flexible facility operations and evolving mission requirements.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."
