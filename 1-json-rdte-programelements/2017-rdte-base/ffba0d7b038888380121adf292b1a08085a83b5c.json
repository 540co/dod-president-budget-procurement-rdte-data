            "val": "Since 1986, the United States and the State of Israel have cooperated on missile defense. Currently, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has three major projects with Israel to develop and improve their indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. These include Upper Tier Interceptors (MD20), the Arrow Weapon System (MD26) and the Short-Range Ballistic Missile Defense, also known as the David's Sling Weapon System (MD34). Within these projects MDA develops and produces weapon systems, conducts tests, and exercises interoperability between U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nU.S.-Israel Cooperative Programs consist of the following major efforts: \n\nIsraeli Upper Tier Interceptor (UTI) Project (MD20): The Upper Tier Program provides the Arrow-3 missile, increasing the system`s capability against advanced medium range threats by providing approximately four times the current Arrow-2 battle space. The primary near term objective is to complete and demonstrate Upper Tier design, and initiate acquisition for Long Lead items and begin Initial Lot Production (ILP).\n\nIsraeli Arrow Weapon System (AWS) (MD26): The Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP) includes block upgrades to the AWS that enhances capabilities against  evolving medium range threats by increasing the total defended area by approximately 50 percent. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pine (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which include the Arrow-3 missile and launcher. Arrow Block 5, under the ASIP agreement will also incorporate a Long Range Detection suite that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and an S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range, early detection and enhanced raid size capacity. The program also includes the continued development of Arrow`s interoperability with U.S. BMDS. Related activities include the Israeli Test Bed (ITB) and the Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) study that assesses requirements and growth paths for the 2025 Israel Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nShort Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD) (MD34): SRBMD, also known as the David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS), is designed to counter short range rockets, cruise missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles and will be integrated into the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture adding another layer of defense to the current Arrow System. Block 1 capability will enhance the short range rocket and missile defense capability.  Block 2 will add capability to defend against medium range and cruise missiles. Block 3 will provide robust defense capability and add significant detection capability to the Israeli Air Defense Architecture The David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) includes the Stunner Interceptor, Missile Firing Unit (MFU), Multi-Mission Radar (MMR), Launch Site Controller (LSC) and the Golden Almond Battle Management Center (BMC). The near term objectives are completion of Block 1 development, demonstrate system capability and flight test, and procure material of Initial Lot Production (ILP) utilizing Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) funding and field the system to the Israeli Air Force for first unit delivery in 2016."

The Upper Tier Interceptor will enhance Israel's indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles by increasing the battle space by a factor of four. The scope of the Upper Tier Program covers interceptor development, testing, material procurement to include initial lot production, and integration of spiral software development for Block 5 AWS. The United States through the cooperative effort gains knowledge and experience of the Israeli Defense Forces operation of a multi-layered defense architecture. This project also includes the procurement of the Silver Sparrow Air-Launched Target which is necessary to validate the performance of the Arrow-3 Missile and related Block 5 spiral development activities. \n\nThe Upper-Tier Interceptor Project Agreement was signed in 2010. This agreement states that the project will be jointly managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization. The agreement also documents the U.S.-Israeli cost share, in which the development costs will be equitable between the U.S. and Israel."

Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which consists of the Arrow-3 missile, launcher and the Long Range Detection Suite (LRDS). The LRDS consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and an S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range and early detection and enhanced salvo engagement capability. The AWS provides Israel an indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. The ASIP effort will enhance the performance of the AWS to defeat longer-range and more robust ballistic missile threats expected to be introduced in the Middle East in the near future. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pine (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). The ASIP also ensures AWS interoperability via Joint Tactical Information Data System (JTIDS) Link-16 common communication architecture with the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System elements such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), AEGIS, Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC), Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN\/TPY-2), and Phased Array Tracking Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) through ground tests, flight tests, and operational exercises.\n\nThe Israeli Test Bed (ITB) provides experiments to evaluate Human Machine Interface (HMI) battle management. Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) conducts studies to assess Israel's future 2025 Missile Defense Architecture. The ITB and ISA&I efforts will continue to support AWS development as well as to define future missile defense architectures and growth paths."

However, a portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint program initiation. Contracts are awarded by IMoD or MDA dependent on what is most advantageous to the Joint Governments. In regard to Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP), IMoD contracts on behalf of U.S. government with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies. For the Israeli Test Bed, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts directly with Elbit Systems, Ltd. while IMoD provides an equitable share of the funding to the U.S. Finally, MDA contracts directly with WALES, Ltd for the Israeli System Architecture and Integration program."
