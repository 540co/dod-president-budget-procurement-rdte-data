DHRA will seek to create a new PE for the FY 2018 Presidents' Budget Submission for this project.\n\nThe Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)).  RDTE funding in FY17 will be applied to the start-up costs for expanding the recruiting database provided to all Military Services for use with officer and enlisted recruiting and to explore the merits of expanding use to civilian recruiting as proposed in a Force of the Future initiative. Specifically, the funds will provide contractor support for the development of a pilot expanded database, procurement of additional directory lists, and the purchase of IT hardware and software for the development of a user- friendly interface for accessing the data.  FY17 RDTE funds in HSPD-12 will be applied to the DoD NextGen USID and will allow the Department  to replace the existing Teslin ID cards which are highly susceptible to counterfeiting due to an outdated design and lack of newer anti-counterfeiting technology, by completing the design of the new card form factor utilizing the latest technical and printing techniques on a plastic substrate which will undergo extensive quality."
