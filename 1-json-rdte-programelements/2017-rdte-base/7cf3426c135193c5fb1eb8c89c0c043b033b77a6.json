                            "val": "This is a Congressional increase to the High Performance Computing Modernization Program.\n\nThis project enables the Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."
