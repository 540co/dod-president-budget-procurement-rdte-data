ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  \n\nEngineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.\n\nInformation and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution\/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.

The purpose is to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analysis of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction studies, and engineering analyses. This project provides the engineering required to improve the design and performance integrity of the SOF platforms, UAV payload sensors and soldier support systems, sub-systems, equipment, and embedded computer software as they relate to the maintenance, overhaul, repair, quality assurance, modifications, materiel improvements, and service life extensions.  This project also conducts risk reduction studies, analyses, and demonstrations to support emerging, time-critical weapons and sensor enhancements.\n\nPlatform Engineering Analysis:  Funding supports engineering assessments and evaluation of technology, manufacturing, and integration readiness in six distinct areas: 1) small UAV payloads; 2) air-to-ground interoperability; 3) mission suite architectures; 4) common sensor suites; 5) low-cost, high-load-out Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGMs) and air-launched UAV; and 6) next generation Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.\n\nSoldier System Engineering Analysis:  Funding supports engineering assessments and evaluation of technology feasibility, producibility, and integration readiness in the following areas: 1) next generation lightweight low-cost body armor and ballistic helmets 2) ballistic and laser variable light transmission protective eyewear 3) soldier worn sensors to assess ballistic and blast events as well as soldier health 4) next generation soldier worn load carriage systems 5) soldier worn head borne communications that provide greater situational awareness and hearing protection.\n\nNational to Theater Transition Engineering Analysis:  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.\n\nAviation Mission Improved Survivability:  Begins engineering analysis activities to address aviation survivability such as signature management, situational awareness, and versatile mission equipment (payloads, communications and weapons) to achieve SOF mission objectives."

For mission suite architectures, identified, assessed, and evaluated open architecture approaches to reduce life-cycle costs, increase responsive integration of new capabilities, and increase competition. In the area of common sensor suites, assessed and evaluated individual sensors and suites of sensors to optimize the commonality of sensors between our manned ISR fleet and our Group IV\/V UAV.  Identified low-cost and high load-out SOPGM and air-launched UAV commodities to reduce costs and provide force multipliers.  Identified, assessed, and evaluated risks\/benefits\/suitability of emerging ISR products and suites.

Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  \n\nBroadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  Develops emerging technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities."
