            "val": "The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, saleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tilt rotorsystems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. \n\nVariable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) will identify and mature critical, relevant variable\/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR)\/Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance(ISR) systems. Autonomous Aerial Cargo\/Utility System (AACUS) will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Structures and Materials program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance\/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability\/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue\/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools. \n\nThese efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N. \n\nThe funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the initiation of the joint Tern program and an increase in AACUS activities as the program enters phase 3.  \n\nThe funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to maturation of AACUS technology applied research effort."

Projects funded in this R2 Activity are intended to be approximately 2-3 years in length.  Based on historical trends approximately 30% of these projects will turn over each year.  The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) encompasses the Independent Applied Research (IAR) efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&T) fleet issues utilizing unique Naval Warfare Center (WC) laboratory capabilities. Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&T Strategic Plan technology using focus areas which engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating WCs with in-house funding for applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions by: \n-Developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems.\n-Promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel.\n-Encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories. \n\nFunded projects are chosen through rigorous internal competition by each WC's selection committee and typically last two to three years.  IAR projects are generally designed to promote investment in high-risk\/high-payoff research and also allow young S&Es to manage Navy relevant research projects. A limited number of successful efforts developed under the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter."
