The increase from FY 2017 to 2018 reflects additional diode purchases to scale the DPAL from the 30 kilowatts planned in FY 2016 to 120 kilowatts in FY 2018 and scale the fully packaged, flight qualifiable FCL from 30 kilowatts in FY 2017 to 50 kilowatts in FY 2019. The decrease from FY 2018 to FY 2019 reflects the downselect from two technologies to the single best technology for further development beginning in FY 2019."

            "val": "The Weapons Technology program element develops and tests a high-powered directed energy laser to build the foundation of the next-generation laser system on a high altitude airborne platform. This laser system will be capable of acquiring, tracking and destroying an enemy missile at a much lower cost per kill than is possible with the existing Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The MDA's laser development investment, incrementally develops scalable, efficient, and compact high energy laser technology in the laboratory before beginning a high power laser flight test program.  The technology required for tracking the target, aiming the laser, and building the flight demonstrator prototype is developed under the Technology Maturation Initiatives (TMI) program element (0604115C).\n\nThe MDA collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, and the Air Force in a systems engineering based strategy to research, develop and test Directed Energy weapons technology.  Within Directed Energy Research MD69 MDA conducts research into the transmission and control of directed energy largely above the atmosphere for mid-term missile defense applications and, ultimately, boost phase intercepts. The MDA is pursuing promising laser technology in a competitive environment with Industry, supported by breakthrough research at the Nation's premier laboratories. The MDA will focus on Directed Energy technology development with the goal of scaling to power levels required for robust, speed of light missile defense.  The MDA is developing a set of common core technology that will enable both missile defense and air dominance missions. These core technologies include fiber launchers; high brightness, high efficiency diode pump modules; and high power, high efficiency fiber amplifiers.  In FY 2017, the MDA, the DARPA and the Air Force will complete a 30 kilowatt packaged FCL system at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory. The system consists of the laser, batteries and thermal device. In FY 2018, The MDA will upgrade the 30 kilowatt packaged FCL to a 50 kilowatt class Fiber Combined Laser (FCL) for demonstration in FY 2019.  In FY 2017, the MDA will upgrade a Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL) testbed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct a 30 kilowatt demonstration with improved beam quality.  The MDA will also complete a design review for a 120 kilowatt DPAL system.  This effort is a prerequisite to conduct a 120 kilowatt laboratory demonstration in FY 2019, after which the MDA will evaluate the DPAL, FCL, and Industry laser systems to select the best approach to continue high power laser system development and fabrication. Each laser will demonstrate the technology necessary to scale the power to hundreds of kilowatts in order to enable the MDA path to boost phase intercept.\n\nThe Agency will make technology investments in Divert and Attitude Control System (DACS) for future BMD interceptors and kill vehicles.\n \nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

                            "val": "The MDA mission is to develop a robust system to defend the United States against ballistic missile attacks at all ranges, in all phases of flight.   Negating a ballistic missile in boost phase, before a threat missile can spawn countermeasures, will revolutionize missile defense by dramatically reducing the role of interceptors.  In FY 2010, the Airborne Laser program proved we could acquire, track and destroy a boosting missile, addressing many aspects of the boost phase kill, but also underscored the complexity and challenges of fielding such a weapon system.  The experience we gained from that successful first foray into directed energy system is pointing us along a new path that integrate a highly efficient, compact electric laser into a high altitude, low Mach Unmanned Aerial Vehicle capable of flying in the stratosphere above the clouds, which diffuse the laser energy. Flying at low speed in relatively calm air at 60,000 feet significantly reduces the complex beam pointing and atmospheric jitter compensation systems that were significant challenges on the Airborne Laser. The key to realizing this future high altitude, unmanned directed energy system is the laser.\n\nWith these lessons learned and breakthrough research at our nation's premier scientific laboratories, the MDA is implementing an incremental roadmap that will prove high power laser technology is ready to execute Missile Defense missions by 2022. This roadmap jointly develops with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Air Force a set of core technologies common to both Air Force and missile defense missions; including fiber launchers; high brightness, high efficiency diode pump modules; and high power, high efficiency fiber amplifiers. \n\nThe Directed Energy Research project funds the laboratory development of two high energy laser technologies, the Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL) with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a Fiber Combined Laser (FCL) with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory. Both laser technologies have considerable promise for scaling to very high average power while simultaneously achieving high system electrical-to-optical efficiencies, exceeding 40 percent, and very low system weight and volume. However, each technology takes a unique approach to attaining high power. The DPAL scales in power by increasing the size of a single laser gain cell. This approach has the benefit of simplicity of design but must address very high energy levels within the single cell. Livermore successfully demonstrated over 10 kilowatts in FY 2015; will demonstrate 30 kilowatts in FY 2017 and scale the system to 120 kilowatts in FY 2019 to address energy scaling. The FCL scales in power by combining multiple individual fiber amplifiers. MDA's key fiber laser investments are targeted at driving the weight per kilowatt of power in the fiber amplifier system down while increasing the individual fiber amplifier power output. MDA joined with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Air Force to demonstrate 44 kilowatts in a room-sized, 40 kilogram per kilowatt configuration in FY 2015, to a packaged 7 kilograms per kilowatt 30 kilowatt system in FY 2017, and increase the compactness and power to a 5 kilogram per kilowatt 50 kilowatt system in FY 2018. \n\nThe MDA strategy is to reduce technical risk through dual path laboratory development and transition the laboratory development to industry for high altitude unmanned platform integration and test.   In FY 2018, the MDA will conduct multiple industry laser studies to investigate high power scaling and technology readiness. In FY 2019, the MDA will select the best available high energy laser technology from the National Laboratories and\/or Industry and develop a prototype 300 kilowatt-class laser system by 2022."

In FY 2017, MDA will continue investment in a competitive next generation solid DACS development with industry to reduce propulsion component risk for the MOKV.  The concept(s) being developed for MOKV application will transition to implementation with the industry MOKV developers.  MDA will also continue to conduct component testing of lightweight, long duration Cooled Gas and Multi-Pulse Attitude Control Systems having application to both a Kill Vehicle and a Third Stage Rocket Motor, while anchoring system sizing and performance prediction models.  MDA will define the baseline requirements using analytical tools to identify mature technology capable of supporting MOKV development.\n\nThe project will also model and assess electromagnetic rail gun projectile technology readiness, suitability, and integration requirements for ballistic missile defense applications."
