Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical\/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 and reducing risk for acquisition programs of record.  Efforts include competitive prototyping earlier in development to facilitate transition of new capabilities into acquisition programs. In Project DS3, efforts are directed by an Army Senior Executive Steering Group to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transition. Project EX3 funds prototyping and demonstration of ground vehicles to assess future concepts and designs against selected capability trades and future technologies for current and future combat vehicles across the combat vehicle portfolio. This PE provides the Army an improved mechanism for fulfilling the goals of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 by enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&T) programs and acquisition programs.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n     \nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC), and Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)."
