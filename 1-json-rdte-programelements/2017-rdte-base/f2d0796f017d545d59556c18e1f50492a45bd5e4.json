These International Agreements (IAs) will:  significantly improve US and allied conventional defense capacity and capabilities; accelerate the availability of defense systems; realize solutions to meet capability gaps; acquire, upgrade, sustain, and\/or support common or interoperable equipment with our allies; create cooperative acquisition, production, or logistic partnerships; promote mutual and equitable sharing of effort, cost, information, and risk; provide operational access; leverage economies of scale; and promote interoperability and commonality with our allies. \n\nThe USAF is party to numerous air, space, and cyber bilateral and multilateral IAs to solve common US and allied military capability gaps, develop materiel solutions, harmonize requirements, and build interoperability with our international partners.  This program element funds the USAF to identify, develop, process, negotiate, conclude, implement, and manage IAs in compliance with statutory provisions, legal authorities, fiscal constraints, technology transfer controls, intellectual property rights, third party transfer provisions, equitability criteria, industrial base factors, and political-military interests.  Included in this budget are:  air, space, and cyber IAC IAs activities; technology assessments; specialized working groups; Air Senior National Representative (ASNR) activities; IAC program and project reviews; bilateral and multilateral staff talks; Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP); and Administrative and Professional Exchange Program (APEP).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, Management and Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.  These funds are not to be used for civilian salaries or the construction of permanent facilities."
