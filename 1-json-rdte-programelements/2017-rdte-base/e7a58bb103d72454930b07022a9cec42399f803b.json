            "val": "The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.\n\nThe Mixed Technology Integration project funds advanced development and demonstrations of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of activities funded in this project include, but are not limited to:  (1) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital; photonic and electronic) or mixed substrate (Gallium Nitride, Gallium Arsenide, Indium Phosphide, or Silicon Germanium with CMOS) technology that will substantially improve the capability of existing components and\/or reduce size, weight and power requirements to a level compatible with future warfighter requirements; (2) development and demonstration of brassboard system applications in such areas as laser weaponry or precision navigation and timing to address mid-term battlefield enhancements; and (3) novel technological combinations (i.e. photonics, magnetics, frequency attenuators) that could yield substantial improvement over current systems."

Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications.  Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT is advancing both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.\n\nSuccessful realization of Micro-PNT requires development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of error sources at the micro-scale, and development of miniature inertial sensors based on atomic physics.  Innovative microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  The program is developing miniature inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.

In parallel, integrated circuit (IC) designers for radio frequency (RF) circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in Silicon.  Historically, a designer would have to decide between the high density of Si circuits or the high performance of CS materials.  Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to  achieve near-ideal \"mix-and-match\" capability for DoD circuit designers with limited demonstrations of the heterogeneous integration of silicon and InP technologies that far exceeded what can be accomplished with one technology alone.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of InP to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity\/density, respectively).  The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, GaN, InP, GaAs, antimonide based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions while enabling higher performance such as power, bandwidth or dynamic range in our electronic systems for electronic warfare, communications and radar.  \n\nThis program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage these complementary efforts to focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers."

For example, Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) Bipolar Complementary Metal-oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes allow CMOS logic to be integrated with radio frequency (RF) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  However, the SiGe process flow was developed to integrate to a single CMOS technology node and significant design and engineering effort is required to retarget the flow for a new node.  Thus, BiCMOS processes tend to lag behind commercial CMOS by several generations.  CHIPS will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology, i.e., one that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN) and SiGe with a standardized interconnect topology.  Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, with a goal of re-use of the IP across applications.  Re-use will allow the DoD to amortize the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single chip systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, CHIPS will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a handful of traditional prime performers.\n\nIn the Advanced Technology Development part of this program, focus will be placed on the development of rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing III-V semiconductors and other microelectronic technologies with advanced Si CMOS.

                                        "val": "The DoD relies on GPS for ubiquitous and accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). With the increased prevalence of intentional GPS jamming, spoofing, and other GPS-denial threats, GPS access is increasingly unavailable in contested theaters and alternative sources of PNT are required.  In particular, guided munitions navigation is the most immediate and among the most demanding of GPS-denial challenges, due to the necessity of operating in highly contested theaters and the stringent requirements for minimization of cost, size, weight, and power consumption (CSWaP). The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-CSWaP inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions navigation.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and CMOS and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance.\n\nAt present, DoD suffers a trade-space dichotomy between low-CSWaP tactical-grade IMUs, based on MEMS inertial sensors, and relatively high-CSWaP navigation-grade IMUs, based on ring-laser or interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (RLG\/iFOG).  RLG\/iFOG is the technology of choice for high-value platforms.  However, for the vast majority of platforms (munitions, dismounts, UAVs), CSWaP necessitates the use of lower-performance, MEMS-based IMUs.  Under the micro-PNT program, DARPA has developed MEMS gyroscopes with performance rivaling that of navigation-grade interferometric fiber optic gyros (IFOGs), thus exposing a new tradespace for low-CSWaP navigation grade IMUs.  The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a complete MEMS-based navigation-grade IMU with an identical mechanical\/electronic interface to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, thereby providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems and rapid transition through early insertion demonstrations.\n\nThis program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide-bandwidth, high-fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems with the potential to drastically reduce the cost, size and weight of these systems.\n\nThe DISARMER program will design, fabricate, and test a hybrid photonic-electronic ADC packaged in a standard form factor.
