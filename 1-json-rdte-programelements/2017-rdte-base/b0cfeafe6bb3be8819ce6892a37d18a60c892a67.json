Project K70 pursues technologies that improve the Soldier's ability to see at night and to   provide rapid wide area search.  It also demonstrates technologies that provide the ability to perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), to integrate disparate sensor architectures, and to enable passive long range target identification (ID). Project K86 matures and evaluates sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment and deception from airborne platforms. It provides pilotage and situational awareness imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently for enhanced crew\/aircraft operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions."

It develops Longwave Infrared (LWIR) imaging sensors capable of providing actionable imagery over a wide range of DVEs.  It also demonstrates a distributed aperture sensing (DAS) approach in which sensing modules are placed around the airframe to enable 360 degree coverage and provide information on potential threats and obstacles for increased situational awareness.  The effort implements DVE-specific multimodal fusion techniques to leverage the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of multiple sensor modalities.  Work in this effort is coordinated with DVE efforts in PE 060211A, Aviation Technology, Project 47A, and PE 0603003A, Aviation Advanced Technology, Project 313."
