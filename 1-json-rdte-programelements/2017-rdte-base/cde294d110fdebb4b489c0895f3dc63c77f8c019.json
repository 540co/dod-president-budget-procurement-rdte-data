Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.\n\nDLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve a high degree of technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.
