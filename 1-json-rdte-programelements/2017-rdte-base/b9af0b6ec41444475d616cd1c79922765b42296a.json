Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized.  In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (i.e., radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems.  For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense (DoD) satellites.  In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention."
