This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services & infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation."

As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.  LIW serves as the single logistics repository which bridges the Army ERP systems (GCSS-Army, LMP, AESIP, GFEBS) with enduring legacy systems. \n\nLOGSA is requesting RDTE funds to develop and enhance the Materiel Common Operating Picture (M-COP).  The M-COP provides interactive views, models, and simulations that directly address Warfighter priorities by giving senior Army leaders the ability to visualize current and future materiel requirements, materiel readiness levels and Warfighter materiel readiness options of the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) at the installation level.  Data from many agencies is integrated into M-COP views, assisting with information superiority for joint and inter-agency operations (examples:  assisting CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, and FEMA)."

The LMI DST directly supports Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. \n\nSpecifically, development will enable the tool to consume and display additional data sources, such as maintenance data from both legacy and Enterprise data sources - a critical capability during the fielding of GCSS-Army; provide additional modules, including Second Destination Transportation Planning, supporting USARC and NGB requirements to deprecate legacy systems and a Readiness Cost Banding module to implement analysis algorithms to deliver decisions to optimize readiness within Army cost constraints. New development will also enable equippers to redistribute items, based on their level of modernization, limiting transportation costs of moving outdated equipment."

The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases."
