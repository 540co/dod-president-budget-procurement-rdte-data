HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Fit (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.\n\nHMS is currently executing a May 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure modified Non-Developmental Items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. Two contracts will be awarded in support of this effort.  The first contract will procure NDI Secret and Below Rifleman Radios (RR) for use in a classified environment.  It was awarded on 29 April 2015. The RR ports the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform.  The second contract will procure Manpack (MP) radios for use in a classified environment. Waveforms to be ported to the MP include: SRW, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)-Army managed waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM)-Army managed waveform, and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS)-Navy managed waveform. \n\nThe Army will award Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts and initial delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (3QFY15 for RR and 3QFY16 for MP).\nb. Award second delivery orders based on qualification test results (4QFY15 for RR and 1QFY17 for MP)\nc. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (2QFY17 for RR and 4QFY18 for MP).\n\nThe FY 2017 budget will provide funding that is necessary to execute the required full and open competition contract strategy for the RR and MP products. Specifically, the funding is needed to conduct testing for the MP candidate products to demonstrate compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for FRP; and to fully fund the full and open competition Operational Evaluation on the MP candidate radios as laid out in the HMS Acquisition Strategy approved May 2014. The funding will also support safety, spectrum supportability, and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding."
