The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counter-fire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was directed in the Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.

LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TMRR Phase.  The FY17 funding will be used to continue execution of two TMRR prototyping and flight demonstration contracts and conduct System Requirements Review (SRR), functional reviews, and prototype design activities and long-lead material procurement to support flight demonstrations and Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs) in FY19. This funding also supports Government management and Government systems engineering and test support activities.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2020 and MS C in FY2024."

The Milestone Decision Authority will hold a MS A decision review in 2QFY16.  After an MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will conduct a limited competition in FY16 of a 45 month TMRR phase using DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for competitive prototyping. TMRR will include two award agreements in 3QFY16 leading to flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY19. Data from the TMRR phase will support the EMD contract competition in FY19 that will result in selection of a single contractor for Engineering and Manufacturing Development at MS B in FY20 to complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and limited user test."
