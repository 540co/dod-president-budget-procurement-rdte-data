            "val": "The Terminal Defense programs provide vital forward-deployable capabilities to support Regional defensive operations.\n\nTerminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) provides the only air transportable, fast reaction capability for the warfighter to provide area coverage against Short and Medium Range Ballistic Missiles within four hours of arrival. The THAAD element includes five major components:  Interceptors, Launchers, Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance - Type 2 (AN\/TPY-2) Radars, THAAD Fire Control and Communication (TFCC), and THAAD Peculiar Support Equipment. THAAD delivered Battery #1 in FY 2009 and Battery #2 in FY 2010 to the U.S. Army at Fort Bliss, Texas, for initial fielding and training. Delivery and fielding schedule for all future batteries is detailed in THAAD Procurement Budget Exhibit.  THAAD has completed the development of the THAAD 1.0 configuration and is developing the THAAD Build 2.0 capability. Continued development and integration will provide enhanced debris mitigation capability, improved interoperability with other BMDS elements, and training devices to support the THAAD Institutional Training Base.  In FY 2016, MDA began a risk reduction effort to explore and to mature the design concept, validate the threat assessment, and develop a life cycle cost estimate for the proposed THAAD Follow On program.  The program seeks to extend the THAAD interceptor's range to expand battlespace and defended area, increase THAAD's interoperability with other air and missile defense systems via the Army Integrated Battle Command System, and incorporate threat upgrades to keep pace with adversary advances. MDA will evaluate the technical merits of these future capability improvements and assess the proposed program's affordability before deciding whether to proceed with the full Follow-On THAAD program.  \n \nCyber Operations sustain MDA Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities; analysis of validation results, risk assessments; reviews of proposed Program Manager\/Information Assurance Manager Plans of Action and Milestones for MDA Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) mission systems; and supports THAAD certification to operate in the BMDS. Cyber Operations include non-recurring requirements from FY 2015 to FY 2017 to transition all THAAD information systems from DIACAP to DoD directed Risk Management Framework.  \n \nPAC-3 is a short range U.S. Army system capability that interfaces with the BMDS. These funds ensure PAC-3 participation in BMDS interoperability integration efforts. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

THAAD provides the only air transportable, fast reaction capability for the warfighter to provide Regional area coverage against Short and Medium Range Ballistic Missiles within four hours of arrival.  THAAD 1.0 Baseline Capability is complete. \n\nTHAAD 2.0 (Advanced Capability Development)  consists of multiple, independent software builds (e.g. Build 2.0, Build 3.0, etc.) to expand the capability of the THAAD 1.0 system, with a projected capability delivery in FY 2019.  New THAAD capabilities include:  1) Launch on Link 16 Based-based BMD System track, providing the ability to initiate an engagement and launch THAAD interceptors using sensor data provided by BMDS sources outside the THAAD Battery; 2) improved THAAD Weapons System performance in the presence of a high debris environment; 3) expanded defended area footprints via remote operation of THAAD Launchers; 4) Regional Peer-to-Peer Engagement Coordination with Aegis and PATRIOT; 5) software upgrades to maintain capability against evolving threats; 6) Message Based Regional Engagement Command to process C2BMC messages to obtain direction for target engagement; 7) Weapon System Information Assurance mandatory updates; 8) Warfighter requested enhancements; and 9) upgrades to  maintain interfaces with other BMDS elements.\n\nTHAAD Follow-On proposes to further improve THAAD defensive capabilities by providing extended range, integrated battle command system, and threat upgrades.  THAAD Follow-On will begin with a risk reduction effort to mature the design concept, validate the threat assessment, and develop a life cycle cost estimate for a proposed future capability improvement.  MDA will assess the technical merits of increasing THAAD's interoperability with other air and missile defense system, and expanding the battlespace and defended area of the THAAD baseline weapon system.  The decision to pursue the full follow-on program will be based on an evaluation of the results of the technical assessment and an affordability determination.       \n\nTHAAD Program Support provides support for communications and interoperability efforts to operate on multiple networks and safety and mission assurance efforts in support of the Materiel Release process.\n\nProgram Operations provides strategic planning, program integration, cost estimating, contracting, financial management, internal reviews and audits, earned-value management and program assessments for the THAAD Program Office.\n\nProject Redwood - Details at a Higher Classification - is reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1) in the Special Access Program Annual Report to Congress."

Cyber Operations includes non-recurring requirements in FY 2015 to FY 2017 to transition all THAAD information systems from DIACAP to DoD directed RMF.\n\nThis project supports the monitoring and tracking of Cybersecurity mitigations detailed in Information Technology security POA&Ms.   Activities include preparation of RMF documentation and accreditation recommendations to the MDA Senior Information Assurance Officer (SIAO)\/Certification Authority (CA) and AO.  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) team actions ensure the availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.  Activities in the Project are necessary to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)."
