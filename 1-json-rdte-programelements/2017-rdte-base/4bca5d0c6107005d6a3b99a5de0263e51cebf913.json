The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities."

Efforts under this project include development of a single solution standard avoiding development of multiple unique solutions and leverage existing interoperability standards developed by NATO. Such standards include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures.  Includes projects formerly titled Multi-National Network Enabled Capabilities, Low Level Air Defense Interoperability, JTRS, Combat Identification, and Multilateral Interoperability Program.\n\nMissile and Rocket Technologies\nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved missile and rocket technologies, such as propulsion, energetic materials, payloads, flight control systems, sensors, and seekers.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nAviation Systems Technologies \nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved aerodynamics, aeromechanics, avionics, weapons and sensor integration, propulsion, and aviation autonomy technologies that improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for vertical lift aviation systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nSoldier Technologies\nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved technologies to increase the effectiveness, health, and reliability of the individual soldier.  Such technologies will maximize soldier survivability, sustainability, mobility, combat effectiveness, and field quality of life.  Efforts under this project will also enable interoperability and standardization among partner country systems that support the individual soldier.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nChemical and Biological Defense Technologies\nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and standardization of chemical, biological, and radiological defense materiel and to develop jointly improved technologies to defend against weapons of mass destruction.  Areas of cooperation include aerosol physics, toxicology, vaccinations, filtration science, agent detection and monitoring, handling, and demilitarization.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nGround Systems Technologies\nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve survivability, weapons, ground platforms (manned and unmanned), and mobility and counter-mobility to provide soldiers with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities in weapons and military vehicles.   Areas of cooperation include ground systems design, propulsion, structures, robotics, alternative fuels and lubricants, systems integration, electronics, and power management.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nWeapons and Munitions Technologies\nThe goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for Army weapons systems and associated munitions.   Areas of cooperation include fuzing and warhead systems, guidance systems, counter improvised explosive device neutralization, directed energy, and fire control systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.\n\nSenior National Representative (Army) program\nSenior National Representatives (Army) (SNR-(A)) Projects with international partners: Supports harmonization of programs at various levels: exchanging information, identifying knowledge gaps and conducting feasibility studies to further promote cooperative development; standardizing, fielding and road mapping various processes; distributing the workload among the different nations. Technology Demonstrations hosted by the U.S. reps to Land Group, NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG), provides an opportunity to observe and demonstrate the current and future capability of participating NATO nations with a view to assisting future operational and materiel interoperability. Army support of NAAG studies, analysis and technology demonstrations.\n\nArmaments Cooperation Enterprise Support\nThe goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program will also include:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); the Technical Cooperation Program, and Army armaments cooperation working groups with many nations."
