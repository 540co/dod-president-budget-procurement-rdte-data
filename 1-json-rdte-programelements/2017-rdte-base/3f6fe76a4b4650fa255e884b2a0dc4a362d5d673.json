In addition, it provides research and reports necessary to support SURTASS LFA and Compact Low Frequency Active (CLFA) sonar compliance with Federal, State and Local environmental laws required for continued SURTASS LFA and CLFA operations, analysis of undersea technology for application to future undersea surveillance capabilities, and assessment of current and future IUSS warfare areas and potential allied Navy contributions. To this end, research is conducted by prominent educational and research institutions recognized for their expertise in the area, and by marine mammal biologists with extensive background in specific areas of underwater acoustics. This approach is deemed the most cost effective and efficient course of action for the Navy."
