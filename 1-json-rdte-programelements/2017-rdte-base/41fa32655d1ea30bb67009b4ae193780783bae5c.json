The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)\/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation by the end of Fiscal Year 2016. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.\n \nArmy Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) or \"Ajax\" is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management."

(1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A developmental efforts will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR). The Bridge Effort's acquisition approach consists of a support agreement with CECOM LCMC SEC as the prime software developer utlizing a mix of government and contractor support. \n\nIn accordance with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirements document approved in 2011, entitled Net Enabled Mission Command (NeMC) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), software capability will be developed in 3-year increments as capability sets designed to Collaborate, Collapse and Converge Mission Command products. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command System of Systems, under a strategy designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition where possible and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems. This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency through deployment as a virtualized server on Battle Command Common Services and web clients."

The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems, to include the successor of GCCS-A. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts."
