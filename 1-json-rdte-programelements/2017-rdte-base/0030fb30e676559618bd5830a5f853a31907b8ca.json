ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army ERP systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). The system will meet the full scope of Army Contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 15 May 2014. On 27 January 2016, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology re-designated the ACWS as an ACAT IAM (MAIS) program and authorized the release of the RFP to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system. Funds are to perform all requisite activities to carry the program through the source selection process, a contract award authority to proceed decision (ATP-1), and a Risk Reduction phase while developing pre-Milestone B documentation expected of an ACAT IAM program."

The new capability is required to replace SPS, PADDS and VCE systems. The end state goal is to streamline contracting end-to-end business processes; reduce operating, maintenance and support costs; decrease and where applicable mitigate the complexity of existing and future interfaces; support financial auditability; and promote and improve efficiencies when integrating with existing ERP systems. An ACWS re-baseline and a new program office estimate were completed following an AAE-directed Red Team Review while ACWS was still an ACAT III program. The updated POE resulted in the program exceeding ACAT I funding thresholds. The new acquisition strategy for the ACAT IAM program was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive, and is pending approval by the Defense Acquisition Executive, who is now the Milestone Decision Authority for the program."
