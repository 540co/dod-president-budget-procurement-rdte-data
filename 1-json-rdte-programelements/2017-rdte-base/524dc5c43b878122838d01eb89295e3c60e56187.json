            "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD\u2019s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.

JTCG\/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG\/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.

The FY 2015 budget provides for Live Fire Test and Evaluation input for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and BLRIP reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and OUSD(AT&L).  The oversight list is maintained continuously and published annually.\n\nJLF Programs and LFT&E Initiatives\n\nIn FY15, JLF funded 26 projects and delivered 24 reports. Focus areas for JLF included projects that either 1) characterized new survivability issues; 2) characterized new lethality issues; 3) improved accuracy and fidelity of weapon data; 4) improved test methods; or 5) improved modeling and simulation methods.\n\n\tJLF Air projects evaluated the effects of internal configuration on helicopter crew compartment fires and conducted egress testing, as well as relevant model validation.  Projects also investigated technologies\/techniques to reduce generic vulnerabilities to all aircraft from threats such as MANPADS and small arms. Other projects included assessment of yawed penetration, missile debris, high energy lasers, the lethality of advanced projectiles, and performed a comparison of commonly used test threats. New projects investigated cabin mounted auxiliary fuel tank vulnerability, ballistically induced hydrodynamic ram effects, and characterized fragmentation grenades. JLF Land projects continued to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets. Land projects also focused on collecting data for validating modeling and simulation tools. Others included the assessment of the use and validity of manikins and helmet performance. New projects studied aging effects on fielded armor and irregular fragment penetration. JLF Sea projects continued to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage. The projects also assessed vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships, fire damage to ship components, including bulkheads, insulation, and reconfigurable spaces.  JLF Sea also investigated asymmetric boat threats, and began work on developing small boat vulnerability models. New projects investigated deep depth underwater explosions, air gun configurations for full ship shock trial alternatives, and explored configurations for augmenting ballistic manikins.\n\n\tAdditional Live Fire initiatives included continued efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including testing for combat helmets and body armor. The initiatives also addressed urgent requests from theater to deploy the Joint Combat Assessment Team to investigate and report to operators, restored the Navy Advanced Mine Simulation System (AMISS), and continued supporting the development of a ground vehicle survivability course.\n\nJASP\n\nIn FY 2015 the JASP continued work on 40 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiated 24 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E. In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness. In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection). In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 33 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2015.\nThe JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness\n\nJTCG\/ME continued to field critical JMEM products to enable on-going CCMD operational Weaponeering and collateral damage estimates along with support to the Anti-air effectiveness community (operational, training, testing, and analysis).  \n\nIn support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG\/ME released the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) Tool v1.2.2, and is finalizing the formal release of JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.2, and Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority v5.3.  \nJWS v2.3 efforts included development and initial integration of enhanced data sets and capabilities include:  new Imagery Interface to implement aimpoint development leveraging the Tasked Target Text Data (T3D) data format implemented by currently fielded mission planning systems.
