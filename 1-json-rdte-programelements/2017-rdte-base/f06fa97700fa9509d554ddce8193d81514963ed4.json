These services\/capabilities are in direct support of Combatant Commanders, the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer, Military Services, and Defense Agencies. The DSO is the focal point for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access. In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government. DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations. This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services. Electromagnetic Spectrum Management enables information dominance through effective spectrum operations."

The E3 Program also supports the development of the Joint Ordnance E3 Risk Assessment Database (JOERAD) and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) electromagnetic environmental effects surveys in support of the COCOMs and Joint Task Forces. JOERAD develops algorithms and provides analytical capabilities to perform real-time risk assessments to evaluate platform\/system safety and identify equipment limitations in the operational EM environment. JOERAD enables operators to make critical decisions about the hazards associated with the use of ordnance within complex EM environments. A SSRA is performed by program managers and materiel developers on all programs that are acquiring or incorporating spectrum-dependent systems or equipment per DoDI 4650.1. These assessments encompassed regulatory, technical, and operational spectrum and E3 issues and associated risks."
