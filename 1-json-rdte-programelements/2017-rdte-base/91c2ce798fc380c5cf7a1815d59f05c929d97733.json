In FY17, the .2 NIE will focus on integrated assessments of Program of Record capabilities for Capability Set (CS) synchronized fielding of Network systems, whereas the .1 NIE\/Army Warfighter Assessment (AWA) will focus on Force 2025 concepts, interoperability & Army Warfighting Challenges, and emerging capabilities. During the .1 NIE\/AWA these funds only support integrated network requirements. These funds also support the four major efforts associated with integration; (1) Integration Planning: planning and coordination with all stakeholders to resource personnel, services, support, equipment, products, and other deliverables needed for platform integration; (2) Preparation: developing engineering design packages and network data products, procuring equipment and materials, performing installation and checkout, and validating the network; (3) Execution: technical support during soldier-led phases of the event, including test execution, (4) Close-out: Recovering platforms, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations, updating documentation, and reporting. These funds provide Subject Matter Expertise to plan, coordinate, integrate and execute the risk reduction for the full System of Systems network\/architecture designs in the NIE and AWA in controlled environments to minimize integration, configuration and interoperability risk in the events, execute diverse and independent portfolio of Network System of Systems performance analyses involving multiple-Program Executive Office (PEO) systems (Command, Control and Communications \u2013 Tactical (C3T), Intelligence and Electronic Warfare & Sensors (IEW&S), Soldier, Ground Combat Systems (GCS), Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (STRI)) and their cross- PEO integration which enables key acquisition-level decisions, Mission Command Network (MCN) and Capability Portfolio Reviews (CPRs). It also enables capability set (CS) architecture product Courses of Action (COAs) development and validation and provides Army Acquisition Executives (AAEs) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) with independent evaluations of PEO\/PM solutions and services, as the advanced  collaboration and coordination with platforms and network system Product\/Project\/Program Managers (PMs) to ensure Capability Set (CS) fielding platform integration design decisions are based on CS Reference Architecture products for CS16-22 to be evaluated in Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events."

Phase I solicits potential solutions from existing Army programs, tech base programs, and industry to deliver capabilities that achieve the Army's Network 2020 Endstates and Objectives and Forces 2025 beyond.  It establishes initial objectives, solidifies the architecture baseline and will establish a viable candidate list for Network Integration Evaluation (NIE).  During Phase II, the project supports the compilations of potential solutions that could meet the Army's Mission Command gaps and the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) identified gaps which supports the development of integration and testing concepts for the NIE.  Phase III includes the coordinated efforts between System of Systems Integration (SOSE&I), Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) at Ft Bliss and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to finalize the brigade architecture \"horseblanket\", integration and test planning, training requirements and combat mission evaluations.  Phase III also includes the initial integration phase where Systems Under Test (SUT) and government\/industry System Under Evaluation (SUE) hardware and software are integrated and initially evaluated for follow-on consideration at Aberdeen Proving Ground's (APG) Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) labs through the Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) process.  This project provides for Network Integration of all SUTs and SUEs (industry and\/or government) Hardware\/Software into existing CERDEC System Integration Laboratories at APG to risk reduce evaluation architectures, network configurations and identify integration issues prior to NIE.  This effort continues into Phase IV as the network matures and becomes functional in the Lab.  The results of this detailed lab based testing\/evaluations will determine which SUTs and industry\/government SUEs will continue in the NIE (Phases IV\/V of the Army's Agile Network Integration process) and establishes the initial Network configuration that will be used in NIE.  LBRR also reduces risk to NIE execution by testing the Network in the lab, resolving issues found in the Network lab test and optimizing the Networks performance.  This is done in a lab environment that facilitates very efficient, cost effective determination of problems, and their subsequent corrections.  \n\nAdditionally this project will integrate the Network at the CERDEC labs facilitate participation by small businesses and interfaces and integrate with Government Programs of Record with unique military secure interfaces and protocols.  Purchase of any additional hardware and support above and beyond the proposed or available support if required for Lab Based Risk Reduction is also funded within this project.  For Government SUEs, this project funds integration support at the CERDEC Labs.  If the NIE program requires additional prototypes above and beyond the Program of Record for the Lab based Risk Reduction, it will also purchase this equipment. This project also funds keeping the Network baseline up to date so that integration is always into the current baseline network."

This project request funds for the coordination of the required activity plan with the applicable Program of Records (PEOs\/PMs). This project does not fund the actual production, integration, nor fielding costs associated with the Tactical Capability Set. This project includes government and contractor efforts to integrate and validate that the Army is fielding platforms, components and software that are integrated together to provide increased capabilities for the soldier that are supportable and trainable.  \n\nThis project includes the following efforts: Provides oversight and direct coordination between participating Program Executive Offices (PEOs), Program Managers (PMs), Research, Development and Engineering Commands (RDECOMs) and the Army's Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) receiving the Tactical Capability Set package, throughout all phases of the Vehicle Integration and Synchronized Fielding process.  This begins with an assembly of multiple programs of record (PORs) integrated into the Army Network to achieve enhanced network performance IAW the requirements validation, content and execution priorities received from the Army G-3\/5\/7 Department of the Army, Military Operations, LandWarNet\/ Mission Command Directorate (DAMO LM).  The Capability Set process development is structured by working with the PORs to define materiel systems Integrated Basis of Issue (IBOI)\/ Architecture by type of Brigade Combat Team (BCT).  Capability Set products that have been Materiel Released\/Type Classified, have production funding and production are aligned by a single Integrated Master Schedule for design integration, testing, production, kitting, platform integration, training and fielding.  This project also includes the direct support during each of the unit's \"New Equipment Training\" and \"New Equipment Fielding\", along with the preparation for the BCT's rotation through one of the Army's Combat Training Centers, (Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) or National Training Center (NTC)).  Upon completion of the Combat Training Center (CTC) rotation the support teams provide oversight to ensure that all training assets are reset and moved to the follow-on BCT and that all After Action activities are closed out.  This project also includes coordination with Department of the Army (DA) staff for synchronization of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) with Integration and Interoperability events leading to a coordinated mission command Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) baseline to support fielding. \n\nThe FY 2017 funding is supporting the CS fielding in CY 2017 and also conducting the planning for CS 18. During FY 2017, the Army's current plan is to conduct four (4) IBCT Tactical Capability Set-Sync Fielding (CS-SF), one (1) TAA SBCT Tactical Capability Set Fielding and one (1) Division Headquarter utilizing five CS-SF teams."

VALEX consisted of four phases: Load, Established, Integrate and Validate Threads.\n\u2022\tDuring the Load phase, network systems and SoSE&I engineers installed network software, firmware, and Operating Systems (OSs), set Internal Protocol (IP) addresses and configured all network systems on all NIE-unique platforms (Note: Program of Record (POR) and Legacy engineers and FSRs performed the same tasks on any of their platforms that participated in the NIE; PORs were NOT funded by SoSE&I to perform these functions). Once all software and data products were loaded, SoSE&I and supporting network engineers and FSRs performed test\/fix\/test processes at the network system and component level.\n\u2022\tDuring the Establish phase, this effort resourced SoSE&I engineers and FSRs to work with Legacy and POR network support personnel to verify network hardware and software performance at the platform level. This effort worked through all issues associated with network system configurations and ensured that each NIE platform had the ability to perform its role within the tactical network.\n\u2022\tIn the Integrate phase, this project enabled SoSE&I engineers and FSRs to work with Legacy and POR network personnel to verify network hardware and software performance at the SoS platform level \u2013 from the small unit (e.g., company, troop, or battery) up to the brigade. This effort worked through all issues associated with network SoS configurations and ensured that each networked tactical units interact with each other as expected.

VALEX consists of four phases: Load, Established, Integrate and Validate Threads.\n\u2022 During the Load phase, network systems and SoS engineers install network software, firmware, and Operating Systems (OSs), set Internal Protocol (IP) addresses and configure all network systems on all NIE-unique platforms (Note: Program of Record (POR) and Legacy engineers and FSRs perform the same tasks on any of their platforms that will participate in an NIE; PORs are NOT funded by SOSE&I to perform these functions).  Once all software and data products are loaded, SOSE&I and supporting network engineers and FSRs perform test\/fix\/test processes at the network system and component level.\n\u2022 During the Establish phase, this effort resources SOSE&I engineers and FSRs to work with Legacy and POR network support personnel to verify network hardware and software performance at the platform level.  This work troubleshoots any issues associated with network system configurations and ensures that each NIE platform has the ability to perform its role within the tactical network.\n\u2022 In the Integrate phase, this project enables SOSE&I engineers and FSRs to work with Legacy and POR network personnel to verify network hardware and software performance at the SoS platform level \u2013 from the small unit (e.g., company, troop, or battery) up to the brigade.

This project explicitly includes critical Common Operating Environment (COE) and Cyber Security engineering, architecture and governance development tasks necessary to develop effective, affordable and secure network capabilities to meet Network 2020 and Force 2025 initiatives. This project captures and manages at the CS level, senior stakeholder guidance (i.e. Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), G3\/5\/7, G2, and Chief Information Officer (CIO)\/G6) to shape future Network Capability Sets (i.e. enterprise scope), Operational Capability Sets (OCS) and Institutional Capability Sets (ICS) (per the approved CIO\/G6 LandWarNet (LWN) 2020 and beyond strategy) and corresponding post\/camp\/station modernization and integrated base defense (IBD) requirements. This project defines and executes its mission in the context of a SoS Engineering Management Plan (SoSEMP), that provides comprehensive engineering, analysis and architecture processes across early CS requirements and roadmap development; engineering and analysis tasks; lab and field risk reduction efforts; Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) system of systems (SoS) scope CS evaluation; and unit-specific architectural planning support to boots-on-the-ground synchronized fielding execution.  These SoSEMP processes deliver authoritative products at a CS\/SoS and platform level that informs and captures senior leadership decisions, supporting critical path execution of CS modernization efforts, including Force 2025 initiatives.  This project includes support to other Department of Defense (DOD) and international agencies for joint programs and collaboration efforts with NIE and Force Basing\/Tactical Capability Set portfolio integration.  The Government effort includes costs for salaries, travel, overtime, training, supplies, facilities, and Information Technology (IT) support.\n\nThis project establishes the capability to develop and deliver authoritative system of system engineering, analysis and architecture products, through focused analysis & trades, against defined and managed CS goals and roadmap. These products provide timely and relevant information to inform decision makers in the Army's modernization prioritization challenges. These products are unique in that they encompass a cross-Program Executive Office (PEO), cross-portfolio perspective of modernization initiatives, affording analysis activities at senior leadership levels for informing Weapon System Review (WSR)\/POM priorities, as well as more strategic challenges such as Force 2025 objectives. The products focus on critical path SoS dependencies necessary to define, evaluate and field CS capabilities, per ARFORGEN. These products are developed in tight coordination with a wide spectrum of stakeholder organizations, from G3 and TRADOC, to PEO\/Program Management Office (PMO) leadership, to gaining units during synchronized fielding. The primary level of effort in this project is in the validation of its products with stakeholder SME, to assure they are relevant, validated and authoritative for supporting CS design and decision challenges. To aid senior leadership and engineering activities in comprehending the complexities of the cross-PEO\/cross-portfolio\/POM scope modernization planning challenges, this project provides for Formation-level Reference Architectures (Operational Views ((OV)-1's), with included NCS SoS Specification and all Army formations, that form the basis for representing and communicating the Army's programmed plan to Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) customers and Program Executive Officers\/Program Managers (PEOs\/PMs).  The LWN NCS SoS Reference Architecture is composed of the NCS Institutional Capability Set SoS Reference Architecture and the NCS Operational Capability Set SoS Reference Architecture. The Institutional Capability Set is composed of the Enterprise Component and Installation Component. Communications and computing for Base Camps and Brigade Combat Teams are also included in the NCS Operational Capability Set. It enables analyses and trades that use the reference architecture design data to inform implementation architectures and support informed systems acquisition decisions across the life cycle. These products are derived directly from an Integrated Basis of Issue Feeder Data (IBOIFD) product that aggregates Program of Record (POR) Basis of Issue (BOI) feeder data, and becomes the managed fielding baseline plan for network procurement decisions, directly feeding unit-specific Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE)\/Modified TOE (MTOE) fielding baselines. This data provides for single authority within Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) for System of Systems Implementation Architecture oversight to inform and manage governance and approvals of emerging SoS designs, defining necessary compliance guidance for SoS scope initiatives and concerns (i.e. Common Operating Environment (COE) and Cyber).\n\nThis project explicitly addresses the orchestration, management, and oversight Common Operation Environment (COE), an Army Priority 1 initiative.  It includes development of vision, strategy, and plans for migrating solutions to a common infrastructure; increase the Army's cyber security posture; decrease life cycle costs; improve and simplify interoperability and integration; and leverage industry and government developed solutions.  \n\nThis project provides ASA(ALT) Cyber Focal for all Cyber requirements.
