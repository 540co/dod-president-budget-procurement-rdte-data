The initial Tanker Replacement increment of KC46s will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The program is procuring four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability which will ultimately be operationally fielded.  During production, the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.  KC-46 funding also supports Training Systems, Direct Mission Support, Program Management Administration (PMA) activities, government developmental and operational test support, mission planning capability development, various studies and analyses, and KC-Y\/KC-Z planning activities.\n\nThe KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for worldwide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battlespace awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe Aircrew Training System (ATS) and the Maintenance Training System (MTS) are being developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The ATS entered source selection on 31 May 2012, and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract will provide Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), to include Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), Boom Operator Trainers (BOTs), Fuselage Trainers (FuTs), and Part-Task Trainers (PTTs) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).  The ATS contract will also support Distributed Mission Operations (DMO), provide aircrew instruction, develop courseware, provide logistics support, acquire a technical data package to support future competition efforts, and manage training device concurrency with the aircraft.  The MTS entered source selection on 8 Jun 2015, with an anticipated contract award date of the third quarter of FY2016, based upon ongoing source selection activities.  The MTS acquisition focuses on designing, developing, testing, producing, and fielding an optimized training system for KC-46 maintainers by integrating various forms of training media and Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) into a \"blended\" solution.  This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, \"high-fidelity\" Augmented Hardware Training Devices (AHTDs), PTTs, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), and emerging technologies to meet validated Air Mobility Command (AMC) maintenance training requirements. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it received MS B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. \n\nThe FY2017 funding request was reduced by $52.609 million to account for a revised risk assessment and deflation."

The KC-46 program released a final RFP on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a MS B DAB on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter EMD from the USD(AT&L) on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract.  The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify the KC-46 as a tanker and certify pairings with receiver aircraft.  \n\nThe MS B Acquisition Strategy planned for two LRIP lots followed by 11 Full Rate Production (FRP) lots for a total aircraft procurement of 175 Production aircraft.  An update to the Acquisition Strategy is in process to support Milestone C (MS C) plans for three LRIP lots and ten FRP lots with the total aircraft buy remaining at 175 Production aircraft.\n\nProduction will begin with two Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and one Not to Exceed (NTE) LRIP options (LRIP-1 Qty 7, LRIP-2 Qty 12, & LRIP-3 Qty 15) followed by 10 FRP options [via NTE values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)].  The LRIP options will be exercised following a successful MS C. The FRP options will be exercised following successful completion of IOT&E.\n\nThe ATS acquisition strategy is to provide ATDs, and associated support structure, to each MOB and the FTU.  The ATS entered source selection on 31 May 2012, and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corporation.  The ATS contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per FAR Part 15, and resulted in an FY2013 EMD FPIF contract.  The ATS EMD phase will develop and procure ATDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft.  The ATS initial production options were exercised in Aug 2015.  The MTS acquisition strategy is to acquire MTDs, and associated support structure, for the two AMC active duty Regional Maintenance Training Facilities.  The MTS entered source selection on 8 Jun 2015, with an anticipated contract award date of the third quarter of FY2016 based upon ongoing source selection activities.  The MTS procurement will be conducted via a full and open competition, per FAR Part 15, and will result in an EMD FFP contract.  The MTS EMD phase will develop and procure MTDs; and will be supported with courseware, Training System Support Center, the technical data package, and support equipment to ensure system availability and concurrency with the aircraft.\n\nBased on market research and a cost effectiveness analysis, the engines were procured as Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) for EMD.  The government (AFLCMC Propulsion Division [AFLCMC\/LPA]) completed an updated market research and cost effectiveness analysis dated 7 Aug 2012.  Based on the updated market analysis and recommendation, the government intends to continue to procure engines from Boeing, but reserves the right to reconsider the procurement of engines if significant changes occur to the aircraft contract and\/or if differential pricing is offered.  \n\nThe KC-46 program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Development Document (CDD) thresholds and objectives for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers.  The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.\n  \nThe long-term support concept for the KC-46 is organic two-level maintenance (2LM):  organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level).  For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level.  The product support strategy will initially employ Interim Contractor Support (ICS) before transitioning to a 100% organically-managed maintenance and supply support capability.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition.  \n\nThis acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed, tested, and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award.  The acquisition strategy defines RAA as 18 aircraft meeting final product baseline with all required training and support in place.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the AMC\/CC determines the unit is operationally war ready."
