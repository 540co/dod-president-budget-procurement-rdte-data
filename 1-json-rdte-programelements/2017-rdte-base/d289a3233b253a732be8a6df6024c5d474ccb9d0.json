HMS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID Program that encompasses specific requirements to support the US Army, US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) communication needs.\n\nHMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge\/most disadvantaged Warfighter with an on the move, at the halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)\/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Fit (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.\n\nHMS is executing the Acquisition Strategy approved in May 2014 to procure modified Non-Developmental Items (NDI) through full and open competition and open to all potential industry partners.  Two contracts support this effort. The contract for NDI Secret and Below Riflemen Radios (RR) for used in a classified environment was awarded on 29 April 2015 to two vendors.  The RR runs the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform.  The contract for Manpack (MP) radios will be awarded in 3QFY16.  These two channel radios can be used in a classified environment and will run SRW, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)-Army managed waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM)-Army managed waveform, and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS)-Navy managed waveform. \n\nThe Army will award Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts (29 Apr 2015 for RR and 3QFY16 for MP)\nb. Award first delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations from Qualification Test (3 Sep 2015 for RR and 1QFY17 for MP)\nc. Award second delivery order based on Customer Test results (2QFY17 for RR and 4QFY17 for MP)\nd. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (1QFY18 for RR and 4QFY18 for MP)\n\nThe FY 2017 budget will provide funding that is necessary to execute the required full and open competition contract strategy for the RR and MP products. Specifically, the funding is needed to conduct testing for the MP candidate products to demonstrate compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; to obtain material release for FRP; and to fully fund the full and open competition Operational Evaluation on the MP candidate radios as laid out in the HMS Acquisition Strategy approved May 2014. The funding will also support safety, spectrum supportability, and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding."

HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Fit (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.\n\nHMS is currently executing a May 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure modified Non-Developmental Items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. Two contracts will be awarded in support of this effort.  The first contract will procure NDI Secret and Below Rifleman Radios (RR) for use in a classified environment.  It was awarded on 29 April 2015. The RR ports the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform.  \n\nThe Army will award Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts (29 Apr 2015 for RR)\nb. Award first delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations from Qualification Test (3 Sep 2015 for RR)\nc. Award LRIP delivery order based on Customer Test results (2QFY17 for RR)\nd. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (1QFY18 for RR)\n\nThe FY 2017 budget will provide funding required for Performance Verification Testing (PVT) for the RR. The funding will also support program office support and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding (e.g., NSA certifications)."
