                            "val": "The Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) program provides the common product-line architecture, product line software, standards, services, and architecture framework for developing the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Product Line of live training systems supporting Army-wide live instrumented Force-On-Force (FOF) and Force-On-Target (FOT) training requirements and is the core live architecture for the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE).\n\nCombat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) funds the continued development of the existing Instrumentation Systems (IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC). CTC-IS funds the continued development of the Range Communication System at the NTC and JRTC, to provide high-fidelity live, virtual, and constructive brigade training rotations which prepare Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint partners, and supporting units to deploy in support of the Army Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM).  The CTCs primary goal is to develop agile and adaptive leaders at the tactical, operational and strategic levels while providing BCTs the core training necessary to conduct decisive action in a dynamic operating environment.  \n\nThe Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) program provides realistic, real-time casualty effects for force-on-force tactical engagement training scenarios and its ability to integrate into training instrumentation systems provide for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises supporting the 39th Chief of the Staff of the Army #1 priority of \"Readiness\".  Due to their modular design, I-MILES is required for use at the Home Station, the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) and in theater of operations to meet force-on-force training requirements.  I-MILES program funding provides the Development and Integration of new vehicle and dismount weapon systems meeting the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements, as well as embedded Tactical Engagement Simulation (TES) development.  This includes new development efforts of the Live Training Engagement Composition (LTEC), increasing simulation of Probability of Kill (Pk) for training realism and improving integration on new weapon platforms (i.e. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), M4A2 Plus Rifle and Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) with 30mm Gun).\n\nThe Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) provides a high-fidelity deployable instrumented training capability to support platoon thru battalion level Live Force-on-Force Training. HITS tracks location of soldiers and vehicles and simulates weapons' effects and engagements, allowing units to \"Train as they Fight\" against live opponents. HITS provides accurate feedback to training units. HITS consists of light deployable components that can be rapidly assembled\/disassembled and transported to support deployed training. HITS integrates with future and legacy MILES. HITS is a member of the Live Training Transformation (LT2) family of training systems and shares several hardware and software components with the Instrumentation Systems (IS). HITS provides the Live domain for Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training integration.\n\nThe Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) provides realistic medical training to both medical and non-medical Soldiers in the Active, Reserve, and National Guard. MSTCs provide hands-on instruction on the latest battlefield trauma and critical care techniques based on Army Medical Department (AMEDD) approved performance oriented Program of Instruction (POI). Medical treatment validation exercises simulate the high stress of performing medical interventions in combat. MSTC supports Unit Medical Readiness by validating Combat Medic (68W) Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) biennial recertification requirements and provides Combat Lifesaver (CLS) training to non-medical Soldiers.\n\nThe Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is the unit\/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot\/don't shoot), which includes escalation of force\/graduated response scenarios.\n\nThe Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) family of systems is a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists (FSS), Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers. The system provides simulated battlefield training to conduct Indirect Fires, Close Air Support, Close Combat Attack, and Naval Surface Fire Support. The CFFT Immersive System provides the capability for Army, Joint, Multinational and Special Operations Forces to conduct advanced, complex and realistic fires training at the FIRES Center of Excellence, Ft Sill, OK. CFFT is a critical training enabler to support Warfighters in applying precision fires on target to prevent fratricide and minimize collateral damage.\n\nThe Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among LVC Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) (to include: AVCATT, CCTT, GFT, HITS, JLCCTC and SE Core) and Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA defines \"how\" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems.  The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance. It develops hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual, Constructive and Gaming communication protocols and to provide a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment.  The integration of the LVC TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger and more robust training events, to better prepare U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost.  The end-state goal is to enable an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can replicate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers. In FY16, Version 2 testing and validation will be complete and the initiation of Version 3 development will follow. FY17 request will continue Version 3 development activities.\n\nThe Target Modernization program provides a common architectural framework, standards, specifications, and interfaces for live fire target devices, a common target control system for all range types, and innovative technologies to enhance training realism and reduce life cycle costs on the ranges.\n\nComprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2) is research and development efforts that include Future Soldier Assessment Tool (DASH-R) Project, Global Assessment Tool (GAT) 3.0 Project, and Program Evaluation (PE) Project.\n\nFY 2017 Project 241 funds significant development efforts in support of U.S. Army Training and Readiness on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES), Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), Target Modernization, Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT), Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Engagement Skills Trainer (EST), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) and Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2)."

The LT2 CPM Next contract will continue development and transition the technology that includes trackless moving targets systems, enhanced infrared\/thermal imaging, and non-contact hit sensing from the initial efforts into the various products, products lines and Program of Records that can utilize the systems.\n\nCall for Fire Trainer (CFFT) \u2013\nIn FY12, the CFFT program awarded a contract to Nova Technologies which has a one-year base and four single-year option periods beginning in August 2012.  The contract provides a lightweight, rapidly deployable, observed fire training system that provides simulated battlefield training for Fire Support Specialists (FSS), Joint Fires Observers (JFO), and Soldiers.  The system provides simulated battlefield training to conduct Indirect Fires, Close Air Support,  Close Combat Attack, and Naval Surface Fire Support. The CFFT Immersive System provides the capability for Army, Joint, Multinational, and Special Operations Forces to conduct advanced, complex, and realistic fires training at the Fires Center of Excellence, Ft Sill, OK. CFFT is a critical training enabler to support Warfighters in applying precision fires on target to prevent fratricide and minimize collateral damage.\n\nEngagement Skills Trainer (EST)\nIn FY14, the EST program awarded contract to Meggitt Training Systems, Inc. which has a one year base and four single year option periods beginning in FY15. The contract provides the unit\/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shot\/don't shoot), which includes escalation of force\/graduated response scenarios.\n\nLive, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) - \nIn FY10, the LVC-IA program awarded a contract to Cole Engineering and Science, Inc. (CESI) which had a two-year base and three single-year option periods beginning in June 2010.  The contract provides for developing, fielding and training each version capability to the designated Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) sites and provides Post-Deployment Software Support (PDSS) for all currently fielded versions. The LVC-IA Enhanced Capability contract will be a follow-on effort beginning the 3rd Quarter FY16.  This award will have a two-year base and four single-year option periods.  This effort will provide the additional capabilities for Version 3 and beyond."
