            "val": "This PE provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, AoAs are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone (MS) Decision. AoAs are a statutory requirement for ACAT I and ACAT II programs and regulatory for ACAT III programs.  The AoAs support the preparation of the Capability Development Document (CDD), Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Thresholds within the CDDs and tradeoff analysis.  The Army must complete an AoA prior to the MS A Decision in order to successfully achieve a MS A decision for new start programs.  This PE provides central funding for new start programs prior to a materiel development decision which do not yet have a Program Manager assigned for materiel development.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plan.  Work in this PE is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The Army is projecting to start work on several AoAs beginning in FY 2017, and will assess and fund the highest Army priorities during the year of execution.\n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $3.374 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."
