The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between IPPS-A, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\n - GoArmyEd is an Army Continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway for soldiers to request Tuition Assistance (TA) and DA civilians to request training funds online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses.  GoArmyEd is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers.  GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  GoArmyED is used by authorized users to pursue their post secondary educational goals: Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; CPMS and TMs to manage civilian training and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.\n\nModernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families.\n\nArmy Human Resource Systems (AHRS) continued to provide the Warfighter with state of art standardized systems that assist the Combatant Commander sustain, train, equip, deploy and account for personnel in and out of Theater.  Systems include the emerging Commanders' Risk Reduction Dashboard, Deployed Theater Accountability System, Range Facility Maint Support Systen and the electronic Military Personnel System."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9 billion combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory.  The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Dept of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million. \n\nFunding for CWID will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development. Funding for ABHIDE will continue development of the system."

The MC4 System supports other Soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army Chief Information Office (CIO) Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management\/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.\n\nFY 2017 Base funding in the amount of $1.207 million will be used for the engineering effort required to provide the Defense Health Clinical Systems (DHCS) TMIP-J software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capabilities.  Activities include:\n--Research of technologies to integrate software into Army future information infrastructure, such as exploration of virtualization for MC4; and Remote Desktop Services applications\n--Evaluation of hardware technology obsolescence and solutions\n--Interfaces with other systems, e.g. Nett Warrior"

The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) integrated software application suite and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since TMIP software is a major component of the MC4 System being developed in increments, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program works with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, etc) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy, incorporating the use of COTS hardware and software, when practicable, in order to realize benefits early and reduce risk.  The AcqBusiness acquisition approach embraces the tenets of Subtitle III of Title 40, U.S.C. (formerly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).\n\nPM AcqBusiness leverages existing DoD and Army enterprise capabilities to fulfill Acquisition Domain business needs whenever possible.  When no Army enterprise systems satisfy approved requirements, priority is given to existing acquisition business systems or services where they are scalable and in conformance with technical architecture standards.  In the event neither of these options is available to satisfy a business need, capabilities are acquired as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. PM AcqBusiness maximizes use of COTS technology by implementing an architecture and infrastructure based on services and virtualization.  If there are no available COTS solutions, PM AcqBusiness will develop the capability, leveraging an incremental approach to enable: (1) consistent and phased definition of requirements, (2) mature technologies, and (3) collaboration among user, tester and developer.  \n\nAs such, PM AcqBusiness is:\n\n- collaborating with the ASA(ALT) community to facilitate Business Process Reengineering in advance of development of AcqBusiness capabilities.  \n\n- encouraging the purchase of commercial products and innovations from private industry.\n\n- involving potential suppliers early in the requirements generation process. \n\n- employing outsourcing wherever possible, and\n\n- acquiring AcqBusiness capabilities in interoperable modules, minimizing the time required to deliver new capabilities to users."

Data Services mission consists of automatic data processing in support of USMEPCOM, the Selective Service System (SSS) and other external agencies for both peacetime and mobilization requirements. MIRS directly supports mobilization in the event of a military draft, through electronic links with the SSS and its ability to process and ship. USMEPCOM\/MIRS is the only DoD organization legally authorized to collect civilian, medical and testing data for purposes of processing into military services and is the only DoD joint support system used to enforce congressional, DoD and Armed Forces qualification criteria for enlistment.  USMEPCOM has established interfaces with US Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship status for applicants of military service to screen out undesired or security threat and Federal Bureau of Investigation for background screening using digital fingerprints to eliminate people with criminal records from entering military service. USMEPCOM's IT sustainment effort will maintain MIRS and the associated network certification and accreditation until the end of system lifecycle.  MIRS was scheduled to be replaced by the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).   VIPS program cancellation has placed USMEPCOMs legacy IT infrastructure at high risk. The resultant system leaves a non-compliant and non-networthy accession system with processing gaps that need to be addressed for secure, compliant, sustainable, and reliable capabilities to meet DoD and Service requirements.  USMEPCOM must continue toward security and data integrity regulatory\/security compliance (PII and HIPAA) or lose Authority to Operate.\nCustomers\/beneficiaries of this investment include the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM and OSD (P&R). \nStakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Asst Sec of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Mgmt Office, USD P&R, USD Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center and Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRequested funding mitigates inefficient system sustainability and scalability through an update of the applications underlying database, operating system and middleware software.  The current legacy system requires time consuming and expensive efforts to make operational changes (even minor ones) to military accessions processing to meet DoD and individual Services requirements. MIRS operational processes exist in a system where business rules and workflow are hard coded throughout the system.  Any changes require extensive review and analysis of the code to see what is impacted before a change can be made, then extensive testing afterwards to make sure it works correctly throughout the accession process.  Currently there are over 600 Problem Reports (PR) and System Change Requests (SCRs) pending. \nRequested funding also provides for a follow-on acquisition plan that will be informed by the recent DCMO initiated Technical Demonstration. The acquisition will provide future enhancements and additional capabilities like those to be proven through the currently evolving Tech Demo.  These efforts will culminate in new USMEPCOM business process vision of an anytime, anywhere accession processing capability."

Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats. Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of TIS that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.  \nThe Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) has moved to PE 0605047 beginning FY17.\nCommander's Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) will consolidate information from multiple Army databases and present to commanders a concise report about which Soldiers in their unit have been involved with at-risk behaviors, some of which may be associated with suicide, and when those instances occurred. The dashboard will be able to generate multiple reports, including one that highlights just Soldiers with risk factors within a certain time period; another that focuses only on newly assigned Soldiers; and another that allows commanders to look at a specific Soldier's history with at-risk behaviors\n\nThe Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System \u2013 Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\nThe Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).  The modification will enable the tool to allow the curriculum development department to author new curricula without having to know a programming language, such as HTML. Currently, the tool has limited authoring templets and doesn\u2019t support the higher language levels or contain testing templets.  The tool will do the programming automatically in the proper format for online viewing regardless of the mobile device used to view the material.  This will enable the author to input the content in a predetermined way and the program will convert it into the proper online format. There will also be programming support to develop and convert existing online material into the current formats for use with all mobile devices regardless of the operating system used. Our current online material does not support all mobile devices and it needs to be reprogrammed to support all current mobile devices regardless of the Operating System (OS) used (Android, Apple, Microsoft).  The Defense Language Institute (DLI) doesn\u2019t have the capability to do any programming modifications to existing programs. The programs are in need of modifications to meet DLI\u2019s new graduation standards of 2+\/2+.      \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY14, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).\nArmy Career Tracker (ACT) is a leader development tool created to change significantly the way training, education, and experiential learning support is provided to Army enlisted, officers, civilians, and their leaders\/supervisors.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership.  ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users manage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals.  ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning.  The unique inter-relationship between the user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and the Army's success.  ACT comprises over 780,000 users with an adoption rate of 4,000 users per week.  HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunities throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).\n\nThe Defense Language Software Upgrade will perform a major modification to the Universal Course Authoring Tool (UCAT).

Thru the CIMS, USACIDC and OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that  houses Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system, known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS), provides US Army Law Enforcement stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of Law Enforcement and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. RDT&E dollars are required to further enhance ALERTS and other CIMS systems to continue the consolidation\/rationalization of LE applications, and to give the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime.\n\nEducational Outreach Initiative:  Defense Forensic Science Center requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. Defense Forensic Science Center was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011). This memorandum states that the DFSC will establish a forensic RDT&E program that provides the integration of joint operational research, including procedures for establishing customer requirements, and identifying gaps and needs that lead to RDT&E priorities. The program includes developing a scholarly environment across the Defense Forensic Enterprise through the use of educational partnerships, internships and fellowships to facilitate participation in RDT&E projects.  The Educational Outreach program will provide an opportunity for students to contribute to forensic science research and influence shared research priorities across the forensic science communities, while supporting the DFSC and laboratory operations. Through the internship program, a variety of innovative research will be conducted that supports research capabilities across the entire range of military operations including traditional, expeditionary (forward deployed laboratories), and reach-back operations.  \n\nResearch & Development Identified through the Broad Agency Announcement Initiative:  The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC) requires funds to coordinate the execution of forensic research projects that will enhance the capability of forensic science applications for DoD customers both in traditional law enforcement\/criminal justice purviews and in expeditionary environments. The DFSC staff will manage federally funded research and development contracts identified through a two year rolling Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) procedure. The BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Research proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, \"The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984\" and subsequent amendments.\n\nFinancial Integrated Reporting Environment (FIRE): FIRE is a U.S. Army Material Command (AMC) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system currently deployed at the Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC). FIRE supports the funding and manpower required to accomplish ARDEC\u2019s reimbursable workload. RDTE is required to develop and expand the system as an enterprise solution across all AMC reimbursable activities. This strategy is in line with existing Army Portfolio Management System (APMS) and Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) Objectives."

An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System \u2013 Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities. ."

As stated above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.\n\nAdditionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state, does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above.

Development tasks will be performed by AG-1 CP's contractor staff, whose performance is monitored according to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Program. In addition, unit testing and operational testing will be implemented to ensure the new functionality performs as required.  This work will be performed on a firm- fixed- price contract vehicle."

In order for the Army to meet appropriate legislative mandates, the new capability will provide improved functionality in general contract writing and contract administration while seamlessly operating in the NIPR, SIPR, CONUS, OCONUS, and in low\/no bandwidth environments. In addition, the replacement capability will produce data that is trackable and auditable by the Army designated finance account system(s) and will be in compliance with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s mandate for implementing internal controls to facilitate full financial audit readiness and accountability.\nArmy Training Information System (ATIS) is an enterpirse system that will provide a common operational picture of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  These capabilities will enable commanders, leaders, soldiers, and civilians to better understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess training requirements so they can more effectively plan, prepare, execute, and assess training. End result is an ATIS that enables soldiers to train as they fight so they can effectively fight as they have trained. \n\nAdapt\/improve\/install\/field government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software to perform various tasks in a networked environment such as data warehousing, force management, personnel, installation and environmental databases and applications to support Business System Transformation and Installation Management, to include Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard.\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has several efforts for which RDT&E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A. Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\nCriminal Information Management System (CIMS): CIMS formerly known as the Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). Thru the CIMS, USACIDC and OPMG developed an integrated and unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that  houses Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data, leveraging existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  The primary component is a comprehensive enterprise system, known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS), provides US Army Law Enforcement stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of Law Enforcement and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements. RDT&E dollars are required to further enhance ALERTS and other CIMS systems to continue the consolidation\/rationalization of LE applications, and to give the LE community the tools to more quickly investigate, solve, and prevent Army crime.\nEducational Outreach Initiative:  Defense Forensic Science Center requires funding for educational outreach initiatives including internship positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral candidate levels. Defense Forensic Science Center was designated as the leader for forensic science disciplines (DAPM Memo 4 Oct 2011).
