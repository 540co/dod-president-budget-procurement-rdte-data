Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competitive scholarship program. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."
