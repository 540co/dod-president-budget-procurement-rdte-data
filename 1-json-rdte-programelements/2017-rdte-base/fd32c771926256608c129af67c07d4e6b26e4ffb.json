These new ships embark, transport, and land elements of Marine landing forces in an assault by helicopters, landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.

The LPD 17 Class configuration must continue to adapt to this evolutionary process, because these ships are expected to be in service until almost 2050.  The LPD 17 design includes system configurations that reduce operating and support costs and facilitate operational performance improvements.   System engineering and integration efforts that began in FY97 will develop further reductions in life cycle costs and will integrate performance upgrades in a rapid, affordable manner.  Possible research and development investigations include improvements in Hull, Mechanical and Electrical systems, advanced sensors, advanced computers, advanced command and control software, advanced information system technologies, and ship based logistics support.   Cost reduction and improved performance will be accomplished through sustained modeling and simulation efforts, resolutions of equipment obsolescence issues, prototype development, continued personnel reduction efforts, system performance tradeoff evaluations, and naval expeditionary warfare system engineering.  Feedback from the Fleet for integrating system configurations will be accomplished through Naval Surface Warfare Centers (Philadelphia, Dahlgren, Port Hueneme, Panama City).  These efforts will result in well defined specifications and drawings in system in system integration design packages that provide technical baseline for follow on ship procurements."
