Conduct cost estimates and affordability analysis with sufficient fidelity across the total life-cycle of the alternative courses of action to identify a preferred system concept. This includes analysis and support of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) execution and Advanced Development Program Office planning. Products include data sets, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to provide OPNAV and OSD the information to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. Conduct briefing support as required by excursions at the direction of the AoA executive steering group."
