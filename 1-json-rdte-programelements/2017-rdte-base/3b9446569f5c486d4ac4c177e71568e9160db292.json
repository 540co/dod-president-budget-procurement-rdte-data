Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability in operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental\/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nTechnologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this project possesses a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.\n\nThe work in this project supports the Army Science and technology (S&T) Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern to minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational\/molecular modeling. Interim projects are used by Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammo and PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors (IEW&S) for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS."

This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality\/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid\/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army Science and Technology Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.\n\nTechnologies developed in this project are fully coordinated and complementary to Program Element (PE) 0603728A, Project 025. \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Research, Development and Engineering Command Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Huntsville, AL, and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, Warren, MI."
