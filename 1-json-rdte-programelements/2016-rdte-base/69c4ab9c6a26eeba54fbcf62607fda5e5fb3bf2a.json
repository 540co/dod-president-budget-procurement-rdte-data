Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration\/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  USAKA\/RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation\/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA\/RTS infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA\/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at USAKA\/RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of USAKA\/RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs."

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: Space and Missile Defense Command-Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC-ARSTRAT) Funding for management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and DoD missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS) will be funded by Project Element 665301.DX2 starting FY15.  The mission has increased two-fold since the beginning of FY14.  Previously funded for 3 work-years to provide contracting support but now the mission requires 6 work-years.  The Headquarters, Army Material Command (HQ AMC) would receive these funds for contracting support missions to the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA)\/(RTS).  The contracting support was transferred from USASMDC-ARSTRAT to the United States Army Contracting Command (subordinate command to HQ AMC) in FY 2013.  RTS is a tenant on the US Army Garrison \u2013 Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), located within the Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking & identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational\/demonstration\/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA ionospheric, space debris, and missile data collection experiments.  RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds drive civilian authorizations to accomplish the contracting support mission which provides end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts.  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software and CONUS based mission control center.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radar in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (Boost-Glide) technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA's space experiments and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs.\n\nNETCOM - The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) funds Department of Army civilian pay, manpower service contracts, supporting IT equipment, and associated costs specifically identified and measurable to plan, manage, coordinate, and execute Information Technology Services Management.  Provides Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) services in accordance with the DA PAM 25-1-1 and the Army C4IM Services List.  Provides Base Communications Support (Service 701), Visual Information (Service 702), Information Assurance (Service 703), and Automation (Service 700).  Includes the delivery of services consisting of secure and non-secure fixed voice communications, wireless voice, data and video connectivity services, and studio video conferencing services.  Provides infrastructure support, including the design, installation, and maintenance of special circuits\/systems in support of life safety\/security systems and monitoring\/control systems.  Provides Collaboration and Messaging Services including services and tools for workforce to communicate and share information.  Provides Application and Web-hosting including operation and management services required to support web and application hosting.  Provides Desktop Management Support including management and support for end-user hardware and software services and tools.  Includes Service Desk Support, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery support.\nJustification: Each of the baseline services provided with this funding are priority zero, must fund, IT utility requirements.  Not funding or reducing the programmed funding will directly impact communications and mission command at all levels on Kwajalein Atoll.\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) between USASMDC\/ARSTRAT and NETCOM: The 16 August 2013 signed MOA between USASMDC\/ARSTRAT and NETCOM formally transfers baseline C4IM functional Areas of Responsibility (Base Communications Support, Information Assurance, and Automation) to NETCOM.  This MOA defines the roles and responsibilities between USASMDC\/NETCOM as well as transfers all USAKA Network Enterprise Center missions, functions, support functions, and programmed resources to support execution of the baseline C4IM Services.  Above baseline services will remain an SMDC responsibility to program and support."
