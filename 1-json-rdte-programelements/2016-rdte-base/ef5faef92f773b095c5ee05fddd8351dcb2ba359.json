Each current project\/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects\/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project\/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR\/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project\/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.\n\nThe NMCS met all FY 2014 performance metrics and is on track to meet its FY 2015 and FY 2016 metrics by delivering suitable products on schedule and within allocated resources 100% of the time."
