This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These studies will assess engineering feasibility of various kill-chain options and assess the capability provided.\n\nSolid State Laser Technology Quick Reaction Capability (SSL-QRC): \n-Completed development of the Solid State Laser Quick Response Capability (SSL-QRC) to upgrade the NAVSEA developed Laser Weapons System (LaWS).  \n-Completed integration and installation of LaWS on a Naval Surface combatant to support an extended demonstration in the Persian Gulf that will conclude during FY 2015.\n\nSolid State Laser Technology Maturation Program (SSL-TM): \n-Continued development of a maritime laser weapons system through competitive procurement.  \n-Initiate Laser System engineering integration trade studies and design with contractor developed designs.  This system will be capable of supporting missions such as small boat, UAV, and ISR disruption and defeat. This work included scientific and engineering trade studies to support integration and test of an advanced development system.  This system will include a maritime beam director and high power, solid state laser (SSL) that is capable of tracking and engaging a surface or airborne target at a suitable stand-off distance in the maritime environment and includes efforts to measure atmospheric absorption and turbulence.\n-Continued development of the Hybrid Predictive Avoidance Safety System (HPASS) to de-conflict laser system operations with friendly sensor and platforms."
