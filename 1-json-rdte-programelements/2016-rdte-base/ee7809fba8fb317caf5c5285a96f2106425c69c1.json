                            "val": "The EC-130H COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare\/Information Operations (C2W \/IO) weapon system.  The employment of this system interdicts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the fielding of the Baseline 2 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  \n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL is a level of effort funded program and employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2016 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems\/simulators.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)\/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) will mirror the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nDue to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
