Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. \n\nDefense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government\/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.

In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, then collecting \u2018fair share\u2019 non-recurring cost recoupment, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. \n\nFunding is increased in FY 2016 to support an expansion of the number of designated systems included in the Defense Exportability Pilot Program and the greater costs of designing in technology protection.  A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY16 will continue defining and implementing DEF \u2018best practices\u2019 related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.

As with the FY 2014 programs, FY 2015 feasibility studies will define the required actions for identifying the feasibility of DEF for programs and beginning DEF designs on select designated programs, and to assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Departments, and to serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure offices to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Acquisition Strategy and the Program Protection Plan (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies are executed."
