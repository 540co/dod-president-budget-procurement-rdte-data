            "val": "This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&L).  Based on the DASD(SE)\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department.  DASD(SE) provides advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, lifecycle management and sustainability functions, and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  \n\nThe DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components, and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance, and School of Science and Engineering (SSE) discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews."

The outcome of this effort is to ensure systems engineering principles and disciplines are fully accepted and assimilated into the DoD acquisition workforce positioning the DoD for acquisition excellence and leading to a stronger national defense.\n\nActivities include the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Work with program managers to prepare systems engineering plans (SEPs) to document the technical management approach.\n\u2022 Conduct periodic program engagements in support of technical reviews to confirm programs are executed in accordance with the SEP.\n\u2022 Review all aspects of the systems engineering process for major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) to ensure they are adequate to support fielding and the achievement of cost and performance goals including reliability, sustainment, and other considerations.\n\u2022 Participate in Systems Engineering Integrated Project Teams (IPTs), Systems Engineering Working Integrated Project Teams (WIPTs), and Systems Engineering technical reviews, especially Preliminary Design Reviews and Critical Design Reviews.\n\u2022 Work with DoD Service program managers, their staffs, and other organizations, technical authorities, and oversight organizations to develop and implement technical management programs for MDAPs.\n\u2022 Conceive plans and lead program support reviews and assessments of MDAP weapons systems and other programs (e.g., Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS)) to shape technical planning and management to ensure program success.\n\u2022 Conduct other technical reviews as requested (e.g., Nunn-McCurdy certification reviews, Non-Advocate Reviews, focused technical assessments, and software readiness reviews to identify and mitigate program risk).\n\u2022 Establish engineering policy, guidance, and workforce development to drive the development of fully capable and supportable weapons systems.\n\u2022 Oversee Component implementation of engineering initiatives and conduct independent assessments.\n\u2022 Develop education and training materials for instructing, maintaining, and enhancing the defense acquisition workforce.  Activities include: (1) developing guidance to enhance Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering (SPRDE) and Production Quality and Manufacturing (PQM) acquisition career planning and progression; and (2) monitoring, and facilitating Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates to the systems engineering, quality and software engineering courses, to ensure the curriculum represents the education and training requirements necessary to be a viable team member in the acquisition process.\n\u2022 Drive an overall improvement in weapon system reliability through improved reliability engineering, reliability growth management, and reliability monitoring in program development contracting, execution, and sustainment.\n\u2022 Prepare and submit annual reports to Congress on the Department\u2019s capabilities and effectiveness in systems engineering and development planning.\n\u2022 Foster program protection planning methodology, system security engineering discipline, industry standards, and engagement with acquisition programs to support risk assessment and vulnerability mitigation.\n\u2022 Guide Service and other component organizations in the development planning process to ensure proposed MDAP programs are executable within acceptable levels of risk.\n\u2022 Resolve long-term major systems engineering challenges such as systems of systems (SoS) systems engineering, systems engineering Complexity Analysis, and systems engineering based technical trade off analysis and pre-program formulation stages. \n\u2022 Provide necessary modeling and simulation policy and guidance, clarify the application of distributed simulation standards and work with the DoD modeling and simulation community to identify and promulgate required capabilities and competencies needed to support acquisition modeling and simulations."

Comprehensive Program Protection Planning links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.
