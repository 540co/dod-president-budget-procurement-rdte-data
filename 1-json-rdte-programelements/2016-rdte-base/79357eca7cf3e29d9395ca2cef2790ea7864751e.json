In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract awarded November 25, 2013, which continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II."
