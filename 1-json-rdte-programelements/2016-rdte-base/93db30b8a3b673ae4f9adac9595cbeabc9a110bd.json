Activities included requirements to support RFI, draft and final RFP packages, NIE testing approach (Type I SUT).  Also, contractor support provided Program, Acquisition, Engineering, Budgeting and Contracts planning preparation, and development.  In addition, Product Manager contractor support continued preparing and developing Army and OSD level statutory and regulatory documentation consistent with DoD Instruction 5000.2, the Defense Acquisition System, and compliant with existing statutory and regulatory policy for a FY16 MS B decision.  These requirements includes Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), Lifecycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), and cost analysis activities, including completion of the CARD, EA, and POE.
