Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.  DURIP is a one year program.\n\nThe increase of funds from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is for the growth in research programs needing instrumentation."

Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.\n\nThe increase in funding from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects increase in research programs in FY 2014.\n\nThe increase in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the increased number of programs in FY 2015."
