Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department\u2019s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.\n\nThis program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of  issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development."

The translator accounts for the distribution of Defense spending among the industries producing the goods and services that support DoD. \n- Modeling and analysis of aircraft survivability against various threat detection approaches and in various operational environments.  Assessing the ability of aircraft and weapons to operate in anti-access\/area denial regions.\n- Modeling and analysis of logistical vulnerabilities against various threats and in various operational environments.  Assessing the cost and mission effectiveness of proposed improvements.\n- Scenarios and modeling for mobile intelligence targets.\n- In support of the Defense Strategic Guidance, analyzing rotary wing programs to assess alternative platforms for combat rescue; examining the cost of all mission alternatives and acquisition strategies."
