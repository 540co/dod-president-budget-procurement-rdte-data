TENCAP's mission is to enable delivery of timely and relevant National Systems data to naval and maritime tactical users.  TENCAP responds to the fleet's top, strategically important capability gaps within National systems and is the Navy's primary interface with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and other national agencies for the rapid fielding (12-18 months) of capabilities. These include advanced sensors, onboard and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports operational missions in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Precision Strike,  Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) management \/ Battlespace Awareness (BA) via multi-source fusion and advanced data analytics. \n\n(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.  Program baseline will also address research and development on Strategic Signals Collection and Exploitation; Undersea Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; Commercial Navigation Radar Detect and Exploit;  Open Ocean Surveillance; Threat Geo-location; and Foreign Command & Control Exploitation.  Link Crimson fields operational prototypes in order to test new capabilities in a real world environment in direct coordination with the operational user. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, joint, and national agency programs.   Additional detailed information is available at a higher level of classification.\n\n(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs."
