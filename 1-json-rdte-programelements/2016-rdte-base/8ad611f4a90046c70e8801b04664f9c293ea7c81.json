Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare capabilities.  To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in:  1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) RF antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive EO sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; and 5) technology for reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike RF sensors and electronic combat systems.  This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

This project also designs, develops, fabricates, and evaluates techniques for integrating combinations of these electronic component technologies.  The project aims to demonstrate significantly improved military sensors of smaller size, lower weight, lower cost, lower power dissipation, higher reliability, and improved performance.

This project determines the feasibility of technologies and concepts for fire control that help to precisely locate, identify, and target airborne and surface targets.  The project emphasizes finding reduced signature targets and targets of opportunity.  It will enable new covert tactics for successful air-to-air and air-to-surface strikes.  This project also develops the technologies required to create trusted autonomic, distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems that provide anticipatory and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), situational awareness, and decision support for multi-layered sensing.  This program provides the technologies for:  1) trusted sensors and trusted sensor systems that will deter reverse engineering and exploitation of our critical hardware and software technology and impede unwanted technology transfer, alteration of system capability, and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems; 2) collaborative tasking of our own distributed heterogeneous sensor networks across a region and co-opted tasking of both traditional and non-traditional adversary sensors; 3) secure sensor web backbone technologies, sensor web physical topologies, and related protocols to assure reliable trusted sensor interactions; and 4) defining architectures for distributed trusted collaborative heterogeneous sensor systems and semantic sensor networks, developing new methodologies for system of systems sensor engineering and analysis, and new techniques for sensor network situation awareness and predictive analytics."

This project also develops and evaluates technology for ISR sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with RF signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple RF phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques.  This project also develops the RF warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. Specifically, it develops techniques and technologies to detect and counter the communications links and sensors of threat air defense systems and hostile command and control networks.  The project also exploits emerging technologies and components to provide increased capability for offensive and defensive RF sensors, including radar warning, RF electronic warfare, and electronic intelligence applications."
