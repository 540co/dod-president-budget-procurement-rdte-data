            "val": "The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) ensures the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP\u2019s portfolio provides solutions to workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD\u2019s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU\/MIs) program.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nScience, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported approximately 1,575 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and, to date, approximately 900 have completed program studies and are currently employed in the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission.\n\nThe National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the NDEP PE to PE 0601110D8Z, beginning in FY 2015.  The NSSEFF program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  Fellows\u2019 work spans a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  The NSSEFF program is a key resource that fosters close connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise, a primary goal of Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) efforts.  Fellows provide DoD the deep scientific expertise of today\u2019s leading research universities and collaborate with DoD scientists and engineers.\n\nSTEM Activities Support (SAS) supports initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E))\u2019s strategic plan for STEM.  SAS fosters conditions for STEM investments to support a diverse, world-class STEM talent pool and workforce to meet national defense needs.  Initiatives include developing and implementing policy guidance, conducting analyses, and developing standards, while ensuring adherence to DoD and Federal initiatives and objectives.\n\nSection 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 directed the Secretary of the Defense to establish a pilot program to enhance the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provide assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  In FY 2016, the Pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade (P-12) Military Child STEM Educational Program continues support for the pilot program."

The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  77 percent have completed their service commitment and are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.\n\nSince FY 2005, approximately 1,575 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2014, approximately 900 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."
