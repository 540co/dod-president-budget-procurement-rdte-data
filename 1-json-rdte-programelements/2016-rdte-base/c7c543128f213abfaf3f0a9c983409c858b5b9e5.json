The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved laser eye protection, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and tactile situational awareness cueing."

Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition and tracking, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and\/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant\/protective\/anti-reflective coatings, observation\/situational awareness improvements, robotic armament capability and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon\/ammunition interface."

Conducted Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the SPS ISSS test candidates in 2QFY14 and obtained Post PDR Assessment Acquisition Decision Memorandum on 15 May 14.  In 2QFY14 completed SPS DT 1 system level plate testing, Vital Torso Protection (VTP), including SPS Torso Protection (TP) ballistic testing.  Continued to integrate new and emerging technologies at the SPS component and subsystem level and transitioned mature components and subsystems to System Capability & Manufacturing Process Demonstration (SC&MPD)\/VS 5. Evaluate component and subsystem technologies across the PPE portfolio (extremities, torso and vital torso, head and face protection) to counter emerging ballistic\/blast threats.  Continued efforts to test, characterize, and increase durability and functional service life of existing personal protective systems.  Continued development and evaluation of ballistic inserts for female and small statured Soldiers, and plan to transition to SC&MPD\/VS 5 through 2QFY15 as the components and subsystems mature.  Completed validation testing of multi-sized head forms with expected transition to Army and National Institute of Justice (NIJ) certified testing laboratories to standardize testing of multiple size helmet and acceptance testing in FY15.
