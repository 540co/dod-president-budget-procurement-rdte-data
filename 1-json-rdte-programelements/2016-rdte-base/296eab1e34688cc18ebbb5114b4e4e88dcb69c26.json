This project cumulatively builds science and technology capabilities in accordance with Army Cyber Material Development Strategy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Cyber Community of Interest.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Air and Soldier\/Squad portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
