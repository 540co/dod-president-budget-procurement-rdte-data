This program maintains or improves the health of critical and fragile defense industry capabilities that are at risk of being lost but are needed at present and\/or have verified future requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The goal of the program is to avoid loss of critical capabilities and resultant reconstitution costs, where affordable and innovative mechanisms are available to the producers in the interim.\n\n\nCriteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (< 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with multiple beneficiaries."

Periodic S2T2 assessments under this program, directed by Title 10 Section 2505, and other assessments collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and\/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical capabilities viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.\n\nThis funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of the risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific product or service likely to be disrupted;  criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted.  These concepts underpin AT&L\u2019s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making.\n\nS2T2 fragility and criticality assessments are applied across the DoD enterprise to identify and prioritize industrial base niches requiring additional investment by DoD.  The purpose of investment is to sustain essential industrial production and design team capabilities.  Projects will focus on high impact industrial base sectors with a combination of defense-specific requirements and low, limited or declining production.  The focus areas are 1) missiles and munitions, 2) space, and 3) other defense-specific capabilities."
