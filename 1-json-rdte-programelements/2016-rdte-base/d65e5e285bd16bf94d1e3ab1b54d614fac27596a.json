This over-the-horizon radar system enables protection of the U.S. and coalition forces, as well as geopolitical assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.\n\nA JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system.  Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment.  The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently.  The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.\n\nJLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats.  This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.\n\nJLENS Product Office successfully demonstrated the system's operational capability with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) proof of concept for the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System exercise. The Exercise used JLENS with an United States Air Force (USAF) operational aircraft and a Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), to track and neutralize targets in August 2013.\n\nJLENS has been directed to support a Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region (NRC) from Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013."

There is currently no funding beyond Block I.  \n\nOn 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed on August 5, 2005.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, the Acting Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the JLENS Nunn-McCurdy (NM) ADM certifying the restructured JLENS Program, and signed a memorandum rescinding the Milestone B approval for the JLENS program, originally granted on August 5, 2005.  This ADM directed the Army to restructure the JLENS program to consist of two Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Orbits; complete scheduled EMD tests and evaluation, to include the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air demonstration, Limited User Test, Developmental Test 2, and Developmental Test 3; to assist in site selection and planning for the employment of one JLENS Orbit to support an operational Continental United States based exercise.  Letters were provided to Congress notifying them that the NM review was complete and the program was certified and restructured as detailed above.\n\nThe Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) reviewed the results of the Army's 60 Day Deep-Dive employment assessment of JLENS for Homeland Defense and concurred with the proposed JLENS employment to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD for an operational exercise duration Fiscal Year 2014-2017.\n\nThe JLENS Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was reset by the Nunn-McCurdy Process in accordance with 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2435(d). The proposed APB was signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 10 July 2013 and the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 8 August 2013. The new Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) reclassified the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) program as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program and removed all Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breaches and reporting requirements.\n\nJLENS has been directed to support the Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region from FY 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of JLENS Orbit deployed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013."
