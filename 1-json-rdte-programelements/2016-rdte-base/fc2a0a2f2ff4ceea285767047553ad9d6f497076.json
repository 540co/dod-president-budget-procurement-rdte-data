These analyses will be acquisition-centered net analyses of the end-to-end blue (US and Allies) capabilities compared to specific red (potential adversary) capabilities focused on identifying the most promising technologies for application to A2\/AD problems.  The analyses will address acquisition specific questions such as: can an existing system be leveraged and\/or can a group of capabilities be combined in different ways to improve the overall effectiveness of US systems?  This office works closely with the Joint Staff, the Military Departments, Combatant Commands, and other Government entities.\n\nIn FY 2015, this project will be moved to PE 0603289D8Z entitled \"Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts.\""
