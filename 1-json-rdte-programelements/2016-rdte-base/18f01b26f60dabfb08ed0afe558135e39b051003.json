Manufacturing Enterprise addresses the development, optimization, and transition of manufacturing enterprise technology to key naval platform suppliers.  Emphasis is on affordability for the following shipbuilding platforms: VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS)\/OHIO Replacement Program (ORP), DDG-51 Class Destroyer, CVN-78 Class Carrier, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and CH-53-K Heavy Lift Helicopter.  \n\nManufacturing enterprise technology areas include, but are not limited to Design for Producibility\/Design for Manufacturability; development of build\/assembly strategies; modeling and simulation technologies; model-based tools and approaches to optimize producibility; intelligent manufacturing planning and factory execution; elimination of inefficiencies in design optimization, material usage, labor utilization, work flow, etc.; supply chain procedures and improvements (such as network centric manufacturing capabilities to facilitate resilient and adaptable supply chains); development of more efficient structural fabrication product lines; and inspection technologies.  Energetics efforts concentrate on developing energetics solutions to ensure the availability of safe, affordable, and quality energetics products largely in support of Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS). \n\nFunding for FY 2016 and beyond has been re-aligned from PE 0708011N and PE 0603758N.   At the R2A level, FY 2016 Funding of $1.200M from Metals Processing and Fabrication, $3.581M from Corporate Investments and $13.955M from Other all in PE 0708011N and funding of $5.338M from Manufacturing Technology S&T from PE06030758N has been re-aligned to PE 0603680N Manufacturing Enterprise\/Other for a total of $24.074M."
