In FY12, as an AF pilot initiative, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred from O&M to RDT&E, AF funds. \n\nSMC is authorized to employ approximately 1,560 civilian acquisition professionals.  This includes all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
