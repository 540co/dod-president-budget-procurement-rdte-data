It will be a direct replacement for the aging OH-58D\/F Kiowa Warrior fleet.\n \nThe aircraft will provide a highly deployable, reconnaissance and security capability that will employ immediately upon arrival into theater.  The platform will address the capability gaps of interoperability, survivability, versatility, agility, lethality, and sustainability to ensure interoperability over extended ranges.  The platform enhances mission effectiveness throughout the operational environment, and focuses on system survivability against threats operating in the contemporary operational environment, while reducing the logistical burden on the tactical unit.  The fundamental purpose is to perform reconnaissance and to provide security in combat operations.  In doing so, it improves the commander's ability to maneuver and concentrate superior combat power against the enemy at the decisive time and place.\n\nNo funding was appropriated in the FY14 budget for Armed Scout Helicopter (53Z)."
