The memorandum directed CDR\/USSTRATCOM to \"Establish a joint center for NAVWAR that leverages on the expertise and infrastructure of the Joint GPS Combat Effectiveness Joint Test & Evaluation program as part of the foundation to better integrate and coordinate NAVWAR Capabilities across the Department.\" JNWC's core RDT&E mission is to conduct Positioning Navigation Timing (PNT) Operational Field Assessments (POFA) to provide the essential discovery and basic knowledge building blocks for all other JNWC missions. POFAs use Combatant Command assets employed against representative threats of specific OPLANs, CONPLANs and Defense Planning Scenarios to determine the impact of and\/or mitigation measures required to operate in an Anti-Access\/Area-Denial A2\/AD) Contested PNT Environment. JNWC leverages the $3M\/year POFAs to develop national-level NAVWAR guidance, develop joint Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), non-material solutions and to upgrade capabilities. The intent of POFAs is to provide timely information for near-term TTP development and realistic training in degraded space support environments. POFAs directly benefit and enhance US and coalition capabilities to operate in A2\/AD contested PNT environments as those expected in the Air Sea Battle Concept.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with \"PNT Superiority.\"  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied \/ degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning.  Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access \/ area denial (A2\/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):\n\n1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.\n2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. \n3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.\n4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):\n\n1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository\n2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term\n3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fudning in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
