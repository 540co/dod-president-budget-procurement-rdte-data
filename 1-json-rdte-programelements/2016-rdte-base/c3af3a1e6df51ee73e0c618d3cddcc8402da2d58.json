These support investigation of physical and chemical properties and interactions for enhanced functionalities important to detection, protection, and decontamination.  BA1 also supports Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) efforts through the National Research Council with Post-Doctorate research associate program, a two week summer camp for high school students and teachers, and Military Internships at West Point.  \n\nThe projects in this PE are placed in BA1 because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities."

Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences have potential application in point and standoff detection, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nano-mechanical resonance sensing, and nano-meter imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics."
