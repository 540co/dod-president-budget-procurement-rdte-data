Concepts that provide capability improvements to Combatant Commanders are identified for accelerated prototype demonstration, and worked as joint projects with the Services to speed transition time for rapid fielding.  Low-Cost Payloads will leverage low cost, commercial, and often low technology options that do not conform to the typical DoD acquisition business model, but have the potential to disrupt and change warfighting capabilities by avoiding or creating technological surprise.
