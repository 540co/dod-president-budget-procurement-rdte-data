            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2002 National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities.\n\nThe Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, the DTRA established the following projects:  RA-Information Sciences and Applications, RD-Detection Technologies, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01)."

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s research and development mitigates these challenges by enabling Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction efforts through advancing radiation detection capabilities.  There are physical limits to the efficacy of traditional radiation detection, and the successful recovery or interdiction of a weapon may depend on detection capabilities that apply much earlier in the nuclear threat chain continuum.  The nuclear threat chain continuum can be defined as the entire spectrum of activities that might lead to the state loss or violent extremist organization acquisition of a nuclear weapon.  Beginning FY 2016, Project RD will conduct research, development, test, & evaluation (RDT&E) to 1) advance detection\u2014both sensor technology and related methodologies\u2014for signatures\/indicators associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials in order to advance U.S. Government capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track Special Nuclear Material by integrating new technologies into detection systems and delivering prototypes for evaluation and further procurement by Services\/Special Mission Units. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter\/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016."

This high priority project focuses on support to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Through enhancing USSOCOM capabilities, this project supports the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force.  The following efforts are included:\n\nThe CWMD-T technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers at multiple nodes along the terrorist development\/acquisition pathway in order to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation research and development (R&D) program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM in which DTRA manages and sub-allocates a portion of this funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s counterterrorism and counterproliferation mission.  New counterterrorism and counterproliferation technologies are developed under USSOCOM management, and in coordination with DTRA, to provide warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nUnder Project RE, the USSOCOM CWMD-T Support Program integrates and federates all-source intelligence and other information with operational analysis to support Combatant Command (CCMD) planning processes related to CWMD-T.  Research is focused on developing and improving technologies to ingest, organize, interpret, and operationalize large amounts of data from many sources, multiple formats, and all relevant classification levels to provide the warfighter with a dynamic picture of the WMD-T operational environment.\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investments in technology solutions supporting operations in subterranean environments.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in technology readiness level."

Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.  Prior to FY 2016, Project RF included funding to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats.

Efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter\/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear\/radiological detection technologies and restructuring DoD-relevant monitoring and verification activities in support of the DoD proliferation monitoring mission. The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The project addresses defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The project addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Service requirements documents, and Combatant Command and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) capability.\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to increased investment in CWMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Technologies.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment to build and conduct the initial full-scale testing of the Next Generation of CWMD weapon concept."

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) provides subject matter expertise for the dose reconstructions.  The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.\n\nThe Mighty Guardian force-on-force tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Military Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage, and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to the Services' procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the Department of Defense (DoD) Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Military Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and loss of assured safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of CCMDs and Military Services.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in the nuclear surety program."

WMD battlespace awareness efforts seek to provide warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats.  This project provides capabilities through the development and integration of multi-mission Unmanned Aerial Systems payloads to emplace sensing technologies, and remotely sense, identify, track, and target WMD-related threats; and, through the development and integration of low visibility, stand-off, and man-portable chemical agent and biological agent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies to sense, identify, track, target, and assess WMD-related threats. The CWMD weapons effects and planning tools effort develops modernized, fast-running, and validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to aid Combatant Commanders\u2019 targeting and aid weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications."

It may be possible or preferable to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for both the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs; and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 was due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software."
