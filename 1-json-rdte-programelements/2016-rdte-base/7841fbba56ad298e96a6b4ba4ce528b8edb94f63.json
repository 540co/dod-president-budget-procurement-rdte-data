            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. \n\nThis PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space & Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the \"key transformational capabilities\" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.\n\nJoint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)\/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE."

The goal of this activity is to support: (1) marine mammal research related to understanding impacts of sound (especially sonar) on marine mammal behavior, hearing, physiology, distributions and ecology; (2) development and testing of new technologies for the detection of marine mammals at sea; The marine mammals research conducted in this PE represents part of a total effort executed in coordination with complementary research performed in PE 0602747N. The emphasis of efforts within PE 0602435N are Marine Mammals and Biology thrusts that include Integrated Ecosystem Research\/Sensor and Tag Development, Controlled Exposure Experiments (captive, free-ranging European waters), part of the Monitoring & Detection thrust (DCL algorithm development), and effects of chronic stress (free-ranging animal studies). \n\nFunding decreases from FY2014 to FY2015 due to completion of studies to examine sensitivity of fish to anthropogenic sound and completion of bioluminescence studies."

Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to increased  research towards developing a predictive capability for the impact of clouds, aerosols, and  moisture gradients in littoral areas on electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in support of new Naval sensors and weapons as part of Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare. Also, to increase capability to assimilate non- traditional data sources such as those from autonomous systems and remote sensing for prediction of conditions in denied and degraded areas. Also an improved application for probabilistic prediction of air and sea conditions for ship routing and operational planning that enables increased energy efficiency and operational effectiveness.\n\nFunding decreases from FY 2015 - FY 2016 due to Completion of the development of the ability to accurately detect, monitor and forecast the 3-D areal extent of global airborne dust, volcanic ash, and smoke and improve aerosol optical depth analyses and forecasts through the use of a suite of satellite sensors and the Navy Atmospheric Aerosol Prediction System (NAAPS)."

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic noise shielding and acoustic propagation models.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic performance predictions."

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement\/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 due to the implementation and integration of coastal forecast models into the TOPSIDE command and control and mission planning system.  These models will have a data assimilation to utilize the data sets featured in the data fusion section of the software.  The system is of interest to Naval Special Warfare and to Naval Oceanographic Office for their Glider Operations Center."
