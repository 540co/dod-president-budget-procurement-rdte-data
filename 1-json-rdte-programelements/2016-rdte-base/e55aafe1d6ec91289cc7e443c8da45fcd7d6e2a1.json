This PE executes the Army's Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) program to mature, integrate and demonstrate ground vehicle leap ahead technologies in support of future combat vehicles. Project 221 matures, integrates and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies such as active protection systems (APS), advanced vehicle armors, blast mitigation and occupant safety devices to address both current and emerging advanced threats to ground vehicles. Project 441 matures and demonstrates advanced ground vehicle power and mobility technologies such as powertrains, power generation and storage, water and fuel logistics, and running gear subsystems for military ground vehicles to enable a more efficient, mobile and deployable force. Project 497 matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware (computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command\/control\/driving mechanisms) and software that result in increased crew efficiencies, vehicle performance, reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) burdens and vehicle maintenance costs. Project 515 matures and demonstrates unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) technologies with a focus on sensors, perception hardware and software, and robotic control algorithms that enable UGV systems to maneuver on- and off-road at speeds which meet mission requirements with minimal human intervention.  \n \nWork in this PE is coordinated with, PEs 0602105A (Materials), 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability, Robotics Technology), 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this PE is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, Michigan."

This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as VICTORY (Vehicle Integration for C4ISR\/EW Interoperability), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this project matures integrated condition based maintenance technologies that reduce the operation and sustainment costs of vehicle electronics and electrical power devices. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Maneuver Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI."

Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and autonomy enabled vehicles protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army-owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.  \n\nThe approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office.\n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Maneuver Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI, in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
