            "val": "Supporting basic research provides the DoD with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities \u2013 including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.  \n\nThe Basic Research Initiatives PE supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program.\n\nStrategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) supports initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E))\u2019s strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  SSBR initiatives support the five aims of:  (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation\u2019s best Scientists and Engineers (S&Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.\n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative, a defense-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the OSD and executed by the Services, seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape the U.S. security interests around the world.  Deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radical actors and regional instabilities develop, supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 QDR, informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally.\n\nThe National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program was realigned from the National Defense Education Program (NDEP), PE 0601120D8Z, to this PE beginning in FY 2015.  The NSSEFF program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  Fellows\u2019 work spans a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  The NSSEFF program is a key resource that fosters close connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise, a primary goal of SSBR efforts.  Fellows provide DoD the deep scientific expertise of today\u2019s leading research universities and collaborate with DoD scientists and engineers."

The Research for Defense Education Faculty (R-DEF) program was designed to augment existing institutional resources by enabling activities such as research by active teaching faculty, PME curriculum development, new academic-government exchange opportunities, and research-informed tabletop exercises.
