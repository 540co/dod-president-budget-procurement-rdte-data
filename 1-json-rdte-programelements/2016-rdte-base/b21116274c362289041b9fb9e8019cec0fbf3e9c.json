In addition, this program supports educational grants to stimulate interest in HELs.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."
