            "val": "This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.\n\nThe Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. \n\nThe Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs and\/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze communities will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. \n\nThe Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the PEOs, thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. \n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.

Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up, cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow Cook Off threats."
