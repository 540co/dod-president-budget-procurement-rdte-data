These include DoD and non-DoD, domestic and foreign infrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and sustaining United States military operations on a global basis.  Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.\n\nSpecifically, DCIP works with the Combatant Commands (CCMD) to determine the mission capability requirements and coordinates with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents (DISLA) to identify and prioritize defense critical infrastructure required to support assigned mission essential tasks. DCIP also works with mission and asset owners to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. DCIP leverages the DISLA inputs to identify the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks that support the identified critical missions. Each DISLA, as identified in DoDD 3020.40 \u201cDoD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure\u201d, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the CCMDs and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; DoD Information Networks (DODIN); health affairs; intelligence; logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  \n\nIn addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts to identify inter- and intra-dependencies DoD has on the critical commercial infrastructure supporting identified missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; communications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL).\n\nFor each functional area and commercial infrastructure area, DCIP examines specific vulnerabilities to DoD missions and develops remediation and mitigation options, incorporating unique analytic insights from engineering and industry best practices to reduce the risk to missions."
