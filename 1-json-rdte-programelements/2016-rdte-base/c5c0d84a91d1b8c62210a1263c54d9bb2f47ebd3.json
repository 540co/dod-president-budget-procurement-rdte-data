            "val": "This Program Element (PE) contains four projects: Maritime Concept Generation and Development (CGCD), Fleet Experimentation , Allied\/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID), and Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering. \n\nThe CGCD project (2356) focuses on the generation, development and validation of warfighting concepts, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and doctrine in order to eliminate war fighting gaps. Beginning in FY 2014, the CGCD project also includes funding for the CNO's Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC), a small group of disruptive thinkers managed by the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) to identify and quickly test in an operational environment, innovative ideas and technologies that are outside the traditional development and acquisition processes.  NWDC also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial) under the guidance of Commander USFF and COMPACFLT.  \n\nThe FLEX project (3319) (formerly Sea Trial) develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of FLEX is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions.  Focusing on war fighting capability improvement through experimentation aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of current Operations Plans (OPLANs), FLEX spans both operational and tactical levels of warfare and reaches across the full range of military operations to enhance war fighting capabilities or fill current or future capability gaps.\n\nThe ACIID and SEW Engineering projects (0798 and 2144 respectively) are systems engineering non-acquisition programs to develop, test, implement technical authority, and validate naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures to support naval missions in the Joint and Coalition Theater. The mission of these projects are carried out by multiple tasks that are used to ensure naval C4ISR Command and Control Warfare (C2W) components of SEW are effectively integrated into service-oriented architecture delivering net-centric warfare capability. Additionally, these projects ensure that (1) the composite operational capabilities of SEW systems (not the individual component systems) conform to the naval C4ISR architecture and enhance war fighting capability as related to the objectives of National Defense Strategy, evolving joint visions and direction, such as net centric capability, and are guided by warfighter requirements; (2) that SEW systems and systems integration efforts involve leading-edge technology transfer of information processing technologies primarily through integration of government and commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS\/COTS) products to enhance the Navy's operational capability, interoperability, warfighter effectiveness, flexible reconfiguration, as well as reduce costs; and (3) that SEW systems integration efforts promote the delivery of Information Dominance and the Navy's contribution to the Global Information Grid (GIG)."

The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACIID program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) and with the Global Information Grid (GiG). Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces are limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and the defeat of Anti-Access Area Denial (A2\/AD). Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich Information Dominance (ID) data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, as well as automatic link establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

                            "val": "The CNO's Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC), created at the CNO's direction in 2013, is a group of junior officers and mid-grade enlisted personnel charged with identifying and developing disruptive and innovative solutions to warfighting problems, and to spread a culture of deckplate innovation througout the Fleet. The intent is to look for innovative ideas, technologies or opportunities outside the normal development and acquisition areas. The CRIC is not a full-time job for these young innovators but a collateral duty in addition to their normally assigned duties.  There are no orders detailing them to the CRIC - just an informal agreement between themselves, their Commanding Officers and the Commander Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) that allows them to spend a portion of their time working on their innovative project.  NWDC manages the CRIC for the CNO and reports directly to the CNO on CRIC issues.\n\nInterested junior officers\/mid-grade enlisted personnel who are passionate about a particular idea\/technology\/opportunity apply to the program in Q2 for membership the following FY.  Their application package identifies their proposed project and how they think it should be approached.  The application packages are reviewed and 8-10 are selected for further consideration based on the background\/experience of the individual and the potential of the proposed project.  The basic criteria for project selection is something that can be brought to a prototype stage within 12-18 months with a small amount of seed money.  The average project will have a total cost in the $800K to $1.2M range (spread over two FYs), with an upper limit of $2M.  Potential projects are reviewed for technical feasibility by Office of Naval Research (ONR) scientists and engineers during Q3, briefed by the CRIC member to a Flag Officer panel (CNWDC, CNR, and OPNAV N81) for interim approval and prioritization, and then approved by the CNO in Q4.  The funding plan for the following FY starts to take shape during the Q3 feasibility review and Flag Officer interim approval.  Approved projects are developed and executed in partnership with other Navy organizations, labs, academic institutions, and industry, typically within that 12-18 month timeframe.  CRIC projects are not focused on addressing today's capability gaps (although some do) but rather to investigate potential solutions or opportunities outside the typical development\/acquisition process.  The CNO's guidance was that CRIC members not work from a list of \"gaps to address\" but rather use their imaginations to work on something of interest to them that could possibly provide value to the Navy.  This process does not allow for building spend plans years in advance - it very much reacts to the interests of the junior officers\/mid-grade enlisted personnel chosen for their innovative spirit and ability to \"sell\" flag officers on their ideas.\n\nAn example of one of the early projects is 3 dimensional(3D) printing, which has the potential to dramatically alter afloat maintenance and logistics by providing the ability to fabricate some types of spare parts on board vice waiting weeks for them to be shipped from a warehouse.  Another is Suspended Underwater Raw Fiber (SURF), a very thin fiber-optic cable suspended beneath the surface of the water that can be deployed from a ship and used for high speed transport of data over tens or hundreds of miles.\n\nSome future projects under consideration address issues such as energy conservation, maintenance cost reduction, and unmanned systems."

For traceability purposes this data appears under both projects.\nFY 2014 CRIC accomplishments included:\n* Completed the Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) project started in FY 2013 and transitioned it to OPNAV N4.  This project placed a 3D printer at Dam Neck and another on board a forward deployed amphibious ship where data was gathered on the various ways sailors were able to use it to make themselves more productive and their jobs easier.  3D printing has the potential to dramatically alter afloat maintenance and logistics by providing the ability to fabricate some types of spare parts on board vice waiting weeks for them to be shipped from a warehouse.     \n* Completed the Electronic Warfare Battle Management (EWBM) project that was kick-started in FY 2013 with a small amount of internally re-prioritized NWDC funding.  This project attempted to integrate meteorological data into an EW battlefield visualization system being developed by ONR.  It showed promise but more work is required beyond the capability of the CRIC, and the project has been picked up by the ONR team.\n* Reached a decision point on the development of the SURF project, a high-speed payout, expendable underwater fiber-optic cable suspended beneath the surface that can be deployed from a ship and used for high speed transport of data over tens or hundreds of miles.  The decision was made to suspend funding on the project pending the resolution of the \"connector\" issue.\n* Completed initial development of the Ocean Augmented Reality project, a next generation \"heads-up\" display using commercial off-the-shelf technology.  The initial tests showed great potential for use in maintenance applications - future work in FY 2015 and possibly 2016 will explore more uses both ashore and afloat.\n* Continued development of the Hyper Agile Model Driven Development (HAMMD) project, a way to more rapidly\/cheaply develop software solutions.  The USAF was originally providing a significant amount of funding but it was lost during USAF budget drills.  The result was a suspension of work pending the availability of additional funding from another source.  \n* Continued development of the Battle School project (kick-started in late FY 2013 with internally re-prioritized NWDC funding), a simulation driven tactical crowd-sourced wargame with potential uses in training and education environments.  Initial response was good, resulting in some modifications that will continue into FY 2015.\n* Began development of the B++ project and transitioned it to NAVCYBERCOM (classified).  The initial demonstration of the project was successful and generated the CNO's comment that \"if the CRIC produces nothing more than B++ it has been a success.\"  Some residual follow-up work to complete the CRIC portion of the project remains to be done with FY 2015 CRIC funding.\n* Began development of the Silent Nemo project, a small, autonomous, biomimetic UUV with potential for use in ISR missions.  Development will continue with some FY 2015 funding with the potential of some carry-over into FY 2016.\n* Began initial planning of the Waste to Watts project, a solid state anerobic digester to convert waste to energy and help reduce energy requirements.  The prototype is being installed at the U.S. Naval Academy."

Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) integrated architectures serve as key components in assessing capability and capacity gaps, enabling analysis of individual platforms and System of Systems (SoS) capabilities in order to achieve the desired warfighting effect.\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has defined several key programs, initiatives and policies that drive Navy requirements prioritization and impact Navy programs of record.  Major such efforts include Joint Information Environment (JIE), Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), and the Department of Defense (DoD) Risk Management Framework (RMF).  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) responsibilities for Information Technology (IT) Technical Authority (TA), Information Assurance (IA) TA, and the Information Dominance Enterprise Architecture (IDEA) will guide Navy's alignment with and implementation of these key, external requirements.\n\nAdditionally, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) N2\/N6 Information Dominance (ID) objectives for Assured Command and Control (C2), Battlespace Awareness, and Integrated Fires capabilities require significant changes and improvements to the Navy's approach for managing its information infrastructure, content, and effects. Potential adversaries will exploit perceived U.S. space and cyberspace vulnerabilities which could impact United States information-handling capabilities and wartime readiness. To realize the ID vision, SPAWAR as the Navy's ID Systems Command, will need to support and enforce implementation of IT and IA TA architectures, specifications, standards and profiles to ensure Navy cyber capabilities are a warfighting asset, not a liability. \n\nThe Space and Electronic Warfare provides three main functions:\n1) Perform SoS and platform technical evaluations to establish the alignment with the OPNAV N2\/N6 ID vision for the Navy and identify performance and operational risks associated with the integration of multiple systems to provide a robust, mission based capability; 2) Develop C4ISR\/IT\/ID integrated architecture products; and 3) Support development of and compliance with C4ISR\/IT\/ID systems engineering processes and standards.  The integrated architecture products are used to support the Navy's budget process by providing a current baseline and a target end state to inform decision-making and prioritization for how the acquisition system will deliver new capabilities to the war fighter. The systems engineering processes and standards provide the construct for Assured C2, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires interoperability requirements analyses to identify capability shortfalls\/gaps and to compare\/test alternatives in a joint end-to end environment while identifying associated Navy-wide C4ISR\/IT\/ID implications. Processes include developing and applying criteria for use in Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) and Gate Reviews, and providing technical inputs and assessments to governance bodies. This includes Human Systems Integration (HSI) to provide a mission-centered orientation to ensure effective operational employment of fielded capability. As joint concepts and OSD efforts\/programs are defined and matured, the Navy's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) integrated architectures are refined in-turn, and the supporting C4ISR systems engineering processes and standards work to engineer and enact C4ISR implementations Navy-wide across all C4ISR mission areas.\n\nProducts provided:\n1) C4ISR, Information Technology (IT), Information Assurance (IA) and Information Dominance (ID) integrated architectures to reflect current, as-programmed and future, target states\n-Fit for Purpose\/Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) compliant architecture views\n-Systems Command (SYSCOM) Technical Authority (TA) specifications, standards and profiles\n-Common processes and tools\n2) Supporting C4ISR\/IT\/ID systems engineering processes\n - Technical standards, architectures, design guidance tools, and policies support to SYSCOMs developing IT systems and connecting to the Navy Enterprise Network afloat, ashore & aloft\n-Technical analysis to Command 10th Fleet (C10F) and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) utilizing an IA Risk Management Framework (RMF)\n-Documentation of IT interfaces to Navy Networks \n-Certifications of systems and applications connected to the Navy Enterprise Network\n-Distributed Command and Control (C2) Interoperability Requirement Analysis - Gaps Analysis, Overlap Analysis, System Priority Lists, C4ISR Metrics and Models, Analysis of Alternatives, Requirements Database, Assessment Repository, Resource Implications Studies, Baseline Performance Models, Mission Task Analysis, Human Systems Integration (HSI) assessments\n-End-to-End Systems Engineering and Integrated Design - Operational feasibility studies, technical feasibility studies, technical roadmap engineering validations, architectures and assessment traceability matrices\n-Joint and Coalition interoperability trials - Joint end-to-end prototyping trials; joint\/coalition interoperability demonstrations; interoperability assessments and metrics; and interoperability studies via the Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) formerly Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID).

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The associated experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment for a wide-range of experiment venues, such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live force events.   \n(2) Provides planning, execution and analysis support to the Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program, a joint U.S. Fleet Forces\/Pacific Fleet effort managed by NWDC, and the only program.  NWDC provides planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, and analysis support for FLEX events to address identified warfighting gaps prioritized in the CUSFF\/CPF Commander's Guidance for Fleet Experimentation.  The FLEX program and efforts of the FLEX team support the \"last tactical mile\" of many other Navy Science and Technology (S&T) programs by supporting those programs when the technology is mature enough and requires evaluation on or by a \"fleet asset\" - ships, airplanes, submarines, sailors.  Reductions in FLEX program support cause many other innovative\/S&T programs to also suffer the consequences through the loss of the expertise resident in the FLEX program\/team.  \n(3) Provides Modeling and Simulation (M&S) support to FLEX and NWDC experimentation efforts.  Where practical M&S is used to stimulate decision making during wargaming and experimentation vice the more expensive and difficult use of live forces.\n(4) Provides for the Navy's Tactical Development and Evaluation (TAC D&E) program, managed by NWDC.  This program, focused on providing near-term solutions to address specific fleet-identified tactical issues.  Proposed projects are submitted by fleet units, prioritized against Commander's Guidance issued by Commander US Fleet Forces and Commander Pacific Fleet, and then funded to the extent of the available funding.     \n\nProducts produced include:\n - Concepts signed by the CNO that influence future funding and technological development\n - White papers (think pieces) intended to generate further discussion within Navy leadership\n - Experimentation final reports (including analysis and recommendations)\n - FLEX event Analysis Reports\n - FLEX event DOTMLPF change recommendations\n - New\/revised doctrinal and Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures publications\n - Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMOs)(draft doctrine)\n - Concepts of Operation (CONOPS)\n - Tactical Decision Aids (TACAIDS)\n\nSpecific products are listed in the Accomplishments\/Plans section of this exhibit.\n\nTis project shows an increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 even though the CRIC is funded from its own project in FY 2016.  The FY 2015 funding, however, did not adequately cover the CRIC projects approved for execution by the CNO (approximately $3M shortfall) nor did it adequately cover experimentation support costs (reduction of contractor support resulted in down-scoping of some experimentation efforts).  The lack of adequate FY 2015 funding has put NWDC in a position where FY 2016 funding will be required during October 2015 to avoid a work stoppage."

                                                "val": "Concept Generation\/Concept Development\n* Completed the Undersea Domain Operating Concept, an idea of how to maintain and maximize our advantages in the undersea environment, which was signed by the CNO along with a POA&M assigning actions to appropriate stakeholders.  One of those actions included developing an Undersea Domain Operating Concept experimentation campaign to assist in turning the conceptual ideas into reality.\n* Completed development of the Information Dominance Enabling Concept: Assured C2 (IDEC) which was signed by the CNO in Dec 2014.  This concept focused on how we prevail in an A2\/AD environment.\n* Completed the Counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C-ISR) concept which is awaiting VCNO endorsement.  This concept is focused on creating a temporary window of access in a robust A2\/AD environment.\n* Completed work on the Joint Concept for Rapid Aggregation (JCRA), a Joint Staff concept that will improve speed of response to global crises given the future operating environment.  The draft is currently being reviewed by the Service N3\/5s.\n* Started development of the Agile Forward Presence concept which is focused on a different way of deploying forces and providing presence.  The first draft is being circulated to numerous stakeholders for feedback.\n* Started development of the Distributed Naval Air Operations concept which is focused on a way of spreading air strike capabilities across multiple platforms.  The first draft is being circulated to numerous stakeholders for feedback.\n* Completed a White Paper for a prospective concept on Operational Logistics (OPLOG).  The concept will focus on ways to mitigate challenges to sustainment in the future operating environment.  This White Paper is at CUSFF\/\/CPF for approval.\n* Completed a White Paper for a prospective concept on Electro-Magnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW).  The concept will focus on methods to enable friendly forces to maneuver within a contested electromagnetic environment.  this White Paper is at CUSFF\/CPF for approval.\n* Began work on an update to the 2006 Operating Concept for the Rail Gun.  NWDC is managing the project with NAVSEA 405 as the customer.  First draft is due in Mar 2015.\n* Worked with the Combined Joint Operations from the Sea Center for Excellence (CJOS COE), a NATO command, on the Allied Maritime ISR concept to improve allied interoperability with ISR capabilities.  Allied Command for Transformation (ACT) has placed this concept on hold.\n\n\nNWDC provides design, planning, systems engineering and integration, modeling and simulation support, event execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment support for a wide-range of Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program experiment venues, such as workshops, seminars, war games, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live force events.  Following is information on some of the FLEX events supported in FY 2014:\n* Completed the Fleet Battle Experiment 13 (FBX 13) as part of the FLEX 2013 Execution Plan. The execution event, done in conjunction with a fleet training\/certification event was delayed to Nov 2013 due to ship scheduling issues.  FBX 13, the culminating event of a three year Counter-Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR) campaign evaluated the tactical use and integration of several classified technologies in an operational environment.  As a result of FBX 13 four new tactical publications have been produced.\n* The Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA) is a complex system of systems capability being deployed on Carrier Strike Groups beginning in 2016.  A multi-year campaign plan was developed to aid in the integration,tactics development, and employment of this complex system.  The FY-14 portion of the multi-year plan included all of the planning and preliminary events leading up to Wargame #2 that was held in Dec 2014.  Those preliminary events included a series of six workshops that developed\/examined NIFC-CA tactics and system capabilities\/limitations.  The Assessment Report (due in Jan 2015) will inform updates to the NIFC-CA CONOPS, other air warfare related doctrinal publications, and fleet training programs and exercises.\n* The Laser Weapon System (LAWS) Experimentation Campaign is a multi-year effort that began in 2012 with BLACK DART 2012 with the first successful engagement of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a laser weapon system from a US warship (USA DEWEY, DDG 105).  As a result of this experiment the CNO directed the installation and deployment of a laser prototype on USS PONCE (AFSB-1) in FY 2014.  An operational demonstration of that system against operationally representative targets in a realistic environment was accomplished in Nov 2014.  That effort, part of the FLEX 2014 plan, is producing a Final Report (including analysis and recommendations) as well as a Solid State Laser Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMO), draft tactics for the safe and effective utilization of this new system.\n* The Aegis Ashore Wargame, conducted as part of the FLEX 2014 Execution Plan, was an examination by Navy stakeholders of the operational, training, and logistics requirements to effectively sustain and operate the Aegis Ashore system as a critical part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach - the President's plan to provide Ballistic Missile Defense of Europe.  This effort produced a QuickLook Report, Final Experiment Report, and an Analysis Report - all of which identified \"wholeness\" gaps (operational, employment, training, logistics and sustainment) as well as an evaluation of the adequacy of the Aegis Ashore Platform Wholeness CONOPS.\n* The JHSV Campaign Plan was conducted in two parts - SPEARHEAD's (JHSV-1) maiden deployment to COMSIXTHFLT and operations in the COMFOURTHFLT area.  The purpose of the campaign, which will continue into FY-15, is to examine other missions for which the JHSV is suitable with little to no modification to the existing sea frame.  The C6F efforts looked at the use of the JHSV in Theater Security Cooperation, Maritime Command and Control, and Afloat Forward Staging Base missions; while the primary focus of the C4F efforts looked at its use in Counter-Illicit Trafficking operations.  A follow-on JHSV\/MLP wargame examined interoperability issues associated with the MLP and the JHSV, LMSR, LCS, and other ship-to-shore connectors.  The major products of the FY-14 efforts include a Final Experiment Report which will inform key OPNAV investment decisions; and revisions to the JHSV Platform Wholeness CONOPS, JHSV Warfighting CONOPS and AFP Fleet CONOPS.    \n* Executed the Obscurants Campaign, a three phased experiment focused on assessing the potential of Naval Obscurants to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. platforms to detection and targeting, and identifying the potential detrimental effects on own-ship systems including radar, communications, machinery and human health.  A great deal of existing data from previous Army and Navy obscurants efforts was utilized in building the campaign plan.  The plan consisted of a Modeling & Simulation event (Phase I), a shore based event (Phase II), and an at-sea event in the COMSEVENTHFLT (C7F) area.  Phases I and II provided risk-mitigation, increased the knowledge base, and aided in the design and planning for Phase III.  Products included a Final Experiment Report and a draft Obscurants Employment Manual.\n* Executed Trident Warrior (TW) 14 in conjunction with RIMPAC, a large multi-national exercise.  Trident Warrior is an annual at-sea warfighting event that in 2014 evaluated the potential military utility of 37 new and emerging capabilities (including eight initiatives sponsored by the AUSCANNZUKUS experimentation alliance) and involved 7 USN ships, 3 allied ships, and 11 US and allied shore installations.  Integrating this experiment into RIMPAC 14 leveraged planned steaming days, flight hours, and the operational environment to conduct a cost-effective large-scale at-sea experimentation event.  The three specific functions of TW were to: (1) identify and capture innovative solutions that addressed prioritized fleet warfighting gaps; (2) refine systems interfaces and interoperability using fleet operator input in an operational environment; and (3) develop and deliver documents that inform operations and key investment decisions.  In addition to the Final Experiment Report (which will include DOTMLPF recommendations), products include changes to seven existing tactical publications, inputs to four tactical publications currently in draft, and the input to five original tactical publications.  Of interest, one of the key initiatives evaluated was the CNO Speed to Fleet Transportable EW Module (TEWM) with the immediate benefit being the accelerated deployment of that system on ships deployed to the C6F area. \n* Continued work on the multi-year Fast Attack Craft\/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC) campaign plan by identifying and testing near-term (within 12 months) capability improvements to the fleet.  The Final Experiment Report will provide recommended changes to current FAC\/FIAC doctrine as well as DOTMLPF recommendations to inform acquisition decisions.\n* Executed Undersea Warfare Employment of Emerging Technologies (USWEET) 14, an experiment focused on evaluating emerging technologies with the potential to close anti-submarine and mine warfare capability gaps.  The focus of USWEET 14 was on shallow water surveillance and several systems were examined.  The Experiment Final Report includes DOTMLPF recommendations that will inform acquisition investment decisions. \n* Executed experimentation phase of Valiant Shield 2014 (VS14), a bi-annual exercise focused on at-sea training in the Pacific area of operations.  The VS14 experimentation phase included 21 experiments and demonstrations examined C-ISR tactics, joint interoperability of selected forces, theater-wide strategic communications, ASW in a multi-threat environment, electronic attack, and distributed basing.  In addition to the VS14 Final Experiment Report (DOTMLPF recommendations), the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Third Party Targeting TACMEMO and the Employment of surface Warfare Tactical Tomahawk TACBUL (Tactical Bulletin) were validated.\n* Executed the Joint Standoff Weapon - C (JSOW-C) employment Limited Objective Experiment (LOE).  The focus was to evaluate live JSOW-C employment tactics using a simulated artillery bunker as a target.  The result were two updates to the TOPGUN manual - one describing JSOW-C employment in a complex tactical environment and the other describing JSOW-C employment in an Electronic Attack environment.\n* Executed the F-35B and LHA\/D Integration Wargame, the focus of which was to inform development of a Fleet Warfighting CONOPS on F-35B employment as part of a large Naval Force beyond the traditional ACE-MEU\/ARG configuration.  This event brought together a large number of subject matter experts to evaluate three different F-35B\/MV-22 embarkation options in a variety of different scenarios postulated in the HQMC LHA\/D and F-35B Integration White Paper and determine the advantages\/disadvantages of each.  In addition to the Final Experiment Report which included the findings and recommendations, this effort informed the development of a F-35B and LHA\/D Fleet Warfighting CONOPS, and recommended changes to the Amphibious Assault Ship and F-35B Aircraft Integration Platform Wholeness CONOPS.\n \nPreliminary planning work was started on the following events in the FLEX Execution Plan for 2015:\n* Continued work on the Trident Warrior experimentation campaign with advance planning for Trident Warrior 15, to be done in conjunction with C7F.\n* Continued planning for the FY15 events in the NIFC-CA Experimentation Campaign.\n* Started advance planning for the FY15 Rail Gun Wargame.\n* Started advance planning for the FY15 Counter FAC\/FIAC At-Sea Experiment.\n* Started advance planning for the Netted Sensors At-Sea Experiment.\n* Continued planning for the COMFOURTHFLT JHSV At-Sea Experiment that was postponed from FY-14 to FY-15 due to equipment casualties.\n* Started advance planning for the 5 Eyes UUV Operations Wargames.\n* Started advance planning for the LPD-17 Wargame.\n* Started advance planning for the Alternative Platforms with Payloads Wargame.\n\nDuring FY 2014 and FY 2015 the CNO's Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC) was funded under Project 2356 - for FY 2016 and beyond Project 2140 has been created for CRIC funding.  For traceability purposes this data appears under both projects.\nFY 2014 CRIC accomplishments included:\n* Completed the Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) project started in FY 2013 and transitioned it to OPNAV N4.  This project placed a 3D printer at Dam Neck and another on board a forward deployed amphibious ship where data was gathered on the various ways sailors were able to use it to make themselves more productive and their jobs easier.  3D printing has the potential to dramatically alter afloat maintenance and logistics by providing the ability to fabricate some types of spare parts on board vice waiting weeks for them to be shipped from a warehouse.     \n* Completed the Electronic Warfare Battle Management (EWBM) project that was kick-started in FY 2013 with a small amount of internally re-prioritized NWDC funding.  This project attempted to integrate meteorological data into an EW battlefield visualization system being developed by ONR.  It showed promise but more work is required beyond the capability of the CRIC, and the project has been picked up by the ONR team.\n* Reached a decision point on the development of the SURF project, a high-speed payout, expendable underwater fiber-optic cable suspended beneath the surface that can be deployed from a ship and used for high speed transport of data over tens or hundreds of miles.  The decision was made to suspend funding on the project pending the resolution of the \"connector\" issue.\n* Completed initial development of the Ocean Augmented Reality project, a next generation \"heads-up\" display using commercial off-the-shelf technology.  The initial tests showed great potential for use in maintenance applications - future work in FY 2015 and possibly 2016 will explore more uses both ashore and afloat.\n* Continued development of the Hyper Agile Model Driven Development (HAMMD) project, a way to more rapidly\/cheaply develop software solutions.  The USAF was originally providing a significant amount of funding but it was lost during USAF budget drills.  The result was a suspension of work pending the availability of additional funding from another source.  \n* Continued development of the Battle School project (kick-started in late FY 2013 with internally re-prioritized NWDC funding), a simulation driven tactical crowd-sourced wargame with potential uses in training and education environments.  Initial response was good, resulting in some modifications that will continue into FY 2015.\n* Began development of the B++ project and transitioned it to NAVCYBERCOM (classified).  The initial demonstration of the project was successful and generated the CNO's comment that \"if the CRIC produces nothing more than B++ it has been a success.\"  Some residual follow-up work to complete the CRIC portion of the project remains to be done with FY 2015 CRIC funding.\n* Began development of the Silent Nemo project, a small, autonomous, biomimetic UUV with potential for use in ISR missions.  Development will continue with some FY 2015 funding with the possibility of some spill-over into FY 2016.\n* Began initial planning of the Waste to Watts project, a solid state anerobic digester to convert waste to energy and help reduce energy requirements.  The prototype is being installed at the U.S. Naval Academy."

The first is the FY 2016 events from the multi-year campaign plans developed to address major capability gaps.  The second is based on recently identified fleet capability gaps that can be addressed within a single event.  The experimentation for those recently identified capability gaps is proposed during the FY 2016 Execution Plan Development Conference scheduled for 1-2 Apr 2015.  At that conference numbered fleets, warfare centers, Navy labs and other stakeholders present their plans and needs for FY 2016.  Those needs are then prioritized based on the Commander USFF\/Commander Pacific Fleet guidance message, combined with the FY 2016 events from the multi-year campaign plans,  and developed into a proposed execution plan that will be refined during Q3 FY 2015 and approved by the two Fleet Commanders in early Q4 FY 2015.  At that point the available FY 2016 funding is applied to the execution plan to form a FY 2016 spend plan and advance planning begins on the FY 2016 experimentation events.  Following that we should have a much firmer picture of the actual events, contract costs, etc.\n\nExecute FY 2016 events of the following Experimentation campaigns:\n* Undersea Domain Operating Concept (UDOC) experimentation campaign (experimentation on ways to maintain and maximize our advantages in the undersea environment).\n* Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA) experimentation campaign (integration of advanced air defense capabilities).\n* Counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C-ISR) experimentation campaign (tactics and technologies to counter the adversary's ISR systems).\n* Command and Control in a Denied\/Degraded Environment (C2D2E) experimentation campaign (tactics when communication systems are attacked).\n* Trident Warrior experimentation campaign with the planning and execution of Trident Warrior 16 (use of the new\/improved N2\/N6 related technologies and tactics selected for examination in FY 2016).  Trident Warrior 16 will be conducted in conjunction with RIMPAC 2016, a multi-national Pacific area training exercise.\n* F-35\/LHD Integration experimentation campaign.\n* Multi-mission strike group operations in a complex electromagnetic spectrum environment (how to best maximize use and minimize mutual interference).\n\nComplete execution of the following FY 2015 experiments that carry over into FY 2016: \n* Joint Assured Access (integration of joint capabilities to assure access when needed).\n* Unmanned Systems Utilization (integrate and maximize existing and developing unmanned systems).\n* Introduction of Adaptive Force Packages for LCS, JHSV and Mobile Landing Platforms (MLP)\n* Introduction of DDG-1000 (integration of new platform).\n* Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (maximize our advantage in the electromagnetic environment).\n\nBegin development of experimentation campaigns as laid out in the CUSFF\/CPF \"Commander's Guidance for Fleet Experimentation\" for FY 2016 and FY 2017 which will be released in Q2 2015.\n\nThere has been no funding available for Tactical Development and Evaluation (TAC D&E) projects since FY 2012 which has resulted in a backlog of proposed projects with tactical utility.  Some of have incorporated into existing or planned experimentation events when practical but most have been deferred.  The TAC D&E program, a CNO directed NWDC responsibility with no dedicated funding line, provides a way for the fleet to identify potential solutions to narrowly defined tactical issues, generally in the form of a Tactical Memorandum (TACMEMO).  Based on current projected FY 2016 funding NWDC expects to dedicate $2-3M across multiple projects drawn from the backlog and new proposals.  Since the purpose of the program is to respond to today's fleet issues, the projects to be funded will be determined in early Q3 2015.  Among those that will be considered are:\n* Tactical usage of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from small platforms such as patrol craft (PCs) and riverine boats.\n* Tactical usage of small UAVs from Military Sealift Command platforms being used in non-traditional missions.\n* Tactical usage of small, armed UAVs in a SOF support role.\n* Tactical usage of small, armed UAVs in a counter FAC\/FIAC role.\n* Tactical usage of small UAVs in a communications relay role.\n* Tactical usage of small Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in a counter FAC\/FIAC role.\n* Revised drop points for light-weight torpedoes against new adversary undersea platforms.\n* Tactical usage of non-traditional weapons against bottomed submarines.\n* Tactical usage of non-traditional weapons against shallow-water mines."

Task orders on the JS J-7 MAC provide the majority of the experiment design, planner, and execution support provided by NWDC to the Fleet Experimentation program.  With the planned availability of $2-3M FY-16 funding for the Navy's Tactical Development and Evaluation (TAC D&E) program after three years of zero funding, it is anticipated that the TAC D&E projects selected for FY-16 funding will be executed under JS J-7 MAC task orders, thus explaining the dramatic increase.  The remaining money is spread across several smaller contracts through NAVSEA, SPAWAR and ONR for CRIC projects and technical support for experimentation and modeling & simulation efforts.

                            "val": "The Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program (formerly Sea Trial) develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of the CUSFF\/CPF directed FLEX program is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions. Implementation is aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of Operations Plans (OPLANS). FLEX is dedicated to providing solutions to near term (within the Fiscal Year Defense Plan) prioritized warfighting gaps as defined by the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (CUSFF)\/Commander, Pacific Fleet (CPF) FLEX annual guidance. \nFLEX exists today because CNOs (past and present) believe experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities.  The FLEX program considers those warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC) through the warfare improvement program; the USFF\/CPF Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL) delivered annually to the CNO; USFF\/CPF Commanders' FLEX Guidance;  and Navy and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements (UONS and JUONS).  Of critical importance to understand is the fact that the FLEX program and associated efforts of the FLEX team support the \"last tactical mile\" of Navy and science and technology (S&T) programs. This \"last tactical mile\" support is delivered through \"at sea\" or \"salt-water\" testing and experimentation at a time when the technology is mature enough and requires evaluation on or by a fleet asset - ships, airplanes, submarines, networks, and\/or sailors. In accordance with the joint CUSFF and CPF FLEX instruction, the FLEX program is the only authorized conduit to conduct experimentation using operational fleet assets. \nFLEX runs the gamut from multi-year campaigns (experimentation of complex DOTMLPF capability), wargames (seminar and systems, workshops, limited objective\/technical experiments and advanced war fighting experiments. The campaigns involve all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products for the fleet. While Navy-centric, FLEX efforts include joint and coalition partners when appropriate.\nExperimentation is vital to the Navy's future.  It  helps inform acquisition decisions and the development of emerging tactics, and it provides unique training opportunities for  today's warfare commander, air, surface, subsurface and information dominance assets. \nFurther reducing or diminishing support of the FLEX program will cause innovative and S&T programs to suffer consequences through the loss of expertise resident in the FLEX program and team.  FLEX faces additional challenges as efforts are becoming increasingly more complex and are being conducted at higher classification levels.  These challenges prevent CUSFF\/CPF from publicizing successes via mainstream channels thereby giving an incomplete impression of FLEX program contributions to the USFF\/CPF organize, train, equip and capability requirements mission. \nWe had to reduce the planned funding for several contracts in FY15 due to the reduction of the FY15 budget from $6.9M to $5.1M.  In addition, planned new contracts\/solicitations for FY15 had to be put on hold or cancelled due to the budget cuts.   \n\nThe contract cost increase for FY16 is based on an assumption that FLEX will receive $8.8M, and can initiate new contract solicitations  to replace expiring contracts, and replace contracts using First In First Out accounting system.\n\nFY16 has only 10 planned experiments because of the varying degrees of complexity for several of the planned events, specifically the EMW campaign. Highly complex threat and introduction of capability take years to experiment with in order to deliver TTP\/TACMEMOs\/Doctrine\/Material capability for the Fleet to train to and use."

Those events ranged from single initiative experiments, such as the live-fire evaluation of JSOW-C employment against a hardened target, to TRIDENT WARRIOR 2014, a large-scale at-sea experiment involving 37 Coalition initiatives conducted in conjunction with exercise RIMPAC 2014, to the NFIC-CA multi-year campaign to incrementally enhance the Fleet's Integrated Air and Missile Defense capability. \n\n-\tEvery FLEX initiative is evaluated and selected for execution during a FLEX event based on several metrics. The two primary metrics are (1) whether or not the initiative can potentially provide  a solution or make a significant contribution to resolving an identified warfighting capability gap, and (2) whether the initiative can be implemented or have an impact in the near term (next 1-3 years). \n-\tOf the more than 20 campaigns completed in FY14, the following 12 campaigns are described in detail to demonstrate specific campaign focus, function, deliverables, and accomplishments. \n\n-\tCampaign: Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA)\n\n-\tFocus: NIFC-CA is a complex system- of-systems capability representing a significant investment by the Navy. FLEX program\/team efforts in 2013 and 2014 support CUSFF's direction to conduct a phased, campaign-style approach to capabilities integration and implementation to improve understanding of NIFC-CA Increment I capability and its employment by Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) in the 2016 time frame. Planned and executed throughout multiple events (workshops, systems and seminar wargames) the FY-14 work to develop appropriate TTP\/SOP\/CONOPS culminated in a fully-informed environment in a December CY 2014 Wargame 2 event. Wargame 2 consisted of the main Modeling and Simulation (M&S)-stimulated operator-in-the-loop (OITL) event, and supporting pre-wargame workshops and Limited Objective Events (LOE) - EMW\/Counter-ISR\/T, Combat ID (CID), Blue Force Laydown\/Stationing, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), and Commander's Conference for Command and Control (C2)\/Composite Warfare Commander (CWC)\/Rules of Engagement (ROE). NIFC-CA Wargame 2 support was provided in the following areas:\n-\t3.1 Wargame Planning and Design\n-\t3.2 Wargame Execution\n-\t3.3 Wargame Data Collection and Analysis\n-\t3.4 Wargame Reporting Outcome and Results\n\n-\tFunctions: Support USFFC in planning, designing, executing, data collection and analysis, and reporting on Wargame 2 results as part of the NIFC-CA Wargame campaign plan.  The intent was to ensure all wargame initiatives were provided end-to-end consistent methodologies resulting in an independent, objective verification of results.  Decision-makers are assured results are reliable and unbiased.\n\n-\tDeliverables: Data Collection and Analysis Plan (DCAP) for the NIFC-CA Wargame, EMW\/C-ISR\/T, CID, Blue Force Laydown\/Stationing, TTP, and Compiled Assessment Report \n\n-\tAccomplishments: Preparations for the wargame included support to six major workshops that developed\/examined draft NIFC-CA tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and system capabilities and limitations.  The results\/deliverables of this wargame informs the NIFC-CA Fleet Warfighting CONOPS and other air warfare related NWPs and NTTPs - and will inform changes to fleet training programs from the classroom to CSG-level COMPTUEXs and JTFEXs.  The result is a more capable integrated air and missile defense CSG. \n\n-\tCampaign: Laser Weapon System (LaWS) \n\n-\tFocus: In August 2012, during BLACK DART 2012 (a FY12 FLEX event), the Navy Air and Missile Defense Command, with support from NWDC, led the execution of a fleet experiment which resulted in the first successful engagement of an unmanned aerial vehicle - with a laser weapon system - from U.S. Navy Destroyer USS DEWEY (DDG 105). As a result, CNO directed installation and deployment of a high-energy solid-state laser prototype on USS PONCE [AFSB(I)]. The system is projected to operate for approximately one year starting late-FY14 with a two-fold purpose:\n-\tFill an immediate capability gap associated with platform and theater\n-\tProvide an opportunity to answer questions to support formal development and operational fielding of high energy laser weapons\n\n-\tFunctions: \n-\tConduct an operational demonstration in support of Solid State Laser Quick Reaction Capability (SSL-QRC) deployment onboard USS PONCE.  \n-\tSuccessfully demonstrate SSL operations against operationally representative targets in a realistic environment.\n-\tInform development of SSL TACMEMO in support of SSL continued operations onboard USS PONCE.\n-\tInform development of high-energy laser for system-of-record deployment on surface combatants.\n\n-\tDeliverables: Solid State Laser TACMEMO that provides crucial guidance for the crew of PONCE (and future platforms) to safely and effectively employ this new weapon system, the   Analysis Report, and LaWS Final Report.\n\n-\tAccomplishments: Without the FLEX program, LaWS,  the Navy's most revolutionary weapon of the 21st century, would not have been employed on a surface combatant nor would it be installed and  in use today on USS PONCE.\n-\tFirst \"shoot down\" of representative UAV in an operational environment\n-\tFirst destruction of ordnance in an operational environment\n-\tEffective interface between CIWS and LaWS\n-\tLaWs embarked and engaged air targets:\n-\tDestroyed all three threat representative UAVs\n-\tDemonstrated High Energy Laze (HEL) reversible jamming of an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor on a UAV\n-\tConducted scoring runs with HEL radiation on a UAV airborne target\n\n-\tCampaign: Aegis Ashore\n\n-\tFocus: The Navy's first Aegis ashore site is scheduled to meet full operational capability in FY 2015. The establishment and follow-on operation of Aegis Ashore presents unique challenges to include: \nfor the entirety of Aegis Ashore. \n-\tThe Aegis ashore CONEMP and MER institutes two commanding officers. \n-\tNavy BMD Enterprise is the forum for coordination but not execution. \n-\tNo single Navy representative can independently assure performance of the Combat System without support functions outside their authority.  \n\n-\tIn light of these challenges, CNO designated USFFC Executive Agent for European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) phase II, responsible for Aegis Ashore wholeness.  To support this effort, USFFC directed a Wargame be conducted involving cognizant navy stakeholders to validate operational, training, and logistics planning in order to ensure the achievement of initial operational capability with proper mission wholeness.  \n\n-\tFunctions: Wargame Objectives:\n-\tIdentify gaps in procedures, resources, manpower, and interoperability of civilian, contractor, and military personnel base-wide at varying readiness states.\n-\tIdentify gaps in training and qualification for AAMDS and AAMDF personnel.\n-\tIdentify gaps in the logistical support, functional roles, responsibilities, and processes.\n\n-\tDeliverables: \n-\tQuicklook and final report documented risks, gaps, and mitigation options for the forward basing, sustainment, and operational employment of Aegis Ashore.\n-\tWargame Analysis Report identifying wholeness gaps in order to influence contract and budgetary requirements including:\n-\tA list of identified operational, employment, training, logistics, and sustainment challenges, and gaps and seams for Aegis Ashore.\n-\tA list of actionable stakeholder items,  based on findings, that will lead to revising CONOPS and governing documents.\n-\tRecommended revisions to the following: host nation agreements, host tenant agreements, emergency action plan, Force Protection plan, development of other security procedures, development of damage control and other emergency procedures, logistics concept of operations, training plan for facility personnel, maintenance procedure development, and medical concept of operations.\n\n-\tAccomplishments: In addition to producing the quicklook report, final experiment report, and analysis report, the effort evaluated the adequacy of the Aegis Ashore Platform Wholeness Fleet Concept of Operations (CONOPS). Installation of the first Aegis Ashore system in Romania in 2015 represents phase 2 of the U.S's EPAA designed to provide ballistic missile defense to portions of the European continent. The FLEX program provided direct support to a key national strategic imperative.\n\n-\tCampaign: Joint High Speed Vehicle (JHSV)\n\n-\tFocus: Conducted at the direction of CUSFF and in direct support of the OPNAV-led LCS\/JHSV Council, the 2014 JHSV campaign  evaluated new missions capable of being supported by the JHSV, with an initial focus on mission options involving little or no modification to the existing sea frame. Completed in two phases during USNS SPEARHEAD's (JHSV-1) maiden deployment to COMSIXTHFLT (C6F) and COMFOURTHFLT (C4F) AORs from Jan-Oct 2014, the effort explored the effectiveness of using various Adaptive Force Packages (AFPs) to expand JHSV platform employment options.  \n\n-\tFunctions: Tasks: \n-\tAerostar was tasked by NWDC\/C4F to provide a turnkey Persistent Surveillance Solution (PSS) on JHSV SPEARHEAD. The PSS solution consisted of a Tethered Aerostat System and an EO\/IR Sensor and Radar System.  \n\n-\tInstallation, integration, and initial operational readiness review on the SPEARHEAD\n-\tProvided labor, travel and Per Diem for all Aerostar support staff\n-\tTIF-25K Aerostat, SSRS-F50 Radar and General Dynamics V9 Camera or equivalent EO\/IR Sensor and required support equipment\n-\tProvided shipping for product to CONUS departure point\n-\tProvided Helium for initial fill of aerostat\n-\tProvided sensor feeds to the SPEARHEAD network\n-\tMonth-to-month operations on the SPEARHEAD\n-\tProvided (1) Flight Director, (2) Operators and (1) Radar specialist for oversight of daily operations, supplemented with the ship's crew for sensor operation, recoveries and deployments\n-\tProvided Helium for required top-offs\n-\tDeflation and pack-out of the PSS System when operations concluded\n-\tPersonnel return travel and Per Diem\n\n-\tDeliverables: \n-\tSuccessful inflation and integration on the SPEARHEAD\n-\tRadar and EO\/IR imagery successfully transmitted to JIATF-S and\/or SOUTHCOM during underway operations\n-\tIn addition to a final experiment report, the products of this effort include revisions to the JHSV Platform Wholeness, JHSV Warfighting, and AFP Fleet CONOPS.\n-\tMore importantly, the results will informs key investment decisions being made by OPNAV regarding the employment of adaptable sensor, communication, and support payloads to enable JHSV to conduct a range of missions beyond those it was originally built to perform.\n\n-\tAccomplishments: Through a series of LOEs spanning the full deployment, this effort assessed the ability of the JHSV platform to support multiple missions such as Maritime C2, Theater Security Cooperation, Counter Illicit Trafficking, Afloat Forward Staging Base, etc.  A follow-on JHSV\/MLP wargame examined interoperability issues associated with MLP and JHSV, Large Medium Speed Roll-On\/Roll-Off (LMSR), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and other ship-to-shore connectors. \n\n-\tCampaign: Fast Attack Craft\/Fast Incoming Attack Craft (FAC FIAC) \n\n-\tFocus:\n-\tEvaluate surface and air weapon effectiveness against FAC\/FIAC-representative targets.\n-\tEvaluate the effectiveness of non-lethal technology to disable small boat engines\n-\tEvaluate the effectiveness of employing an armed Switchblade UAS against FAC\/FIAC target\n\n-\tFunctions: \n-\tFLEX resources were used to manage and coordinate Navy stakeholder's efforts in this mission area in order to identify warfighting capability solutions, validate results, and deliver results to the Fleet over the next 12 months. \n\n-\tDeliverables:  \n-\tIntegrated, validated DOTMLPF-P solution set - Near Term Focus\n-\tNew\/revised TTPs\n-\tTraining & Readiness input\n\n-\tAccomplishments: In addition to a final experiment report, this effort provided DOTMLPF-P recommendations to inform acquisition investment decisions and also provided recommended revisions to current counter FAC\/FIAC doctrine.\n\n-\tCampaign: Undersea Warfare Employment of Emerging Technologies (USWEET)\n\n-\tFocus: USWEET investigated emerging technologies having potential to close warfighting gaps identified in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and mine warfare (MIW) IPCLs. Planned and executed by C3F, NMAWC, STDG, and NWDC, the event was  conducted on the Southern California Operating Area (SCORE) Range, Mine Training Areas, and other SOCAL areas to meet technology objectives. \n\n-\tFunctions: \n-\tBuilding on lessons learned from USWEET '13, for each exercise a small array (2-3) of small form-factor, low power, passive sensors mounted to surface buoys were employed in shallow and deep water marine environments to detect contacts of interest and output an assessment of the size, speed, and bearing of the detected contact. \n-\tFLEX supported  core services funding for Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) experimentation to include  SWSS test planning, testing specific hardware fixtures, personnel travel, support watch standers, diver services, crane services, small craft transportation and support for testing, data collection, and post experiment data analysis leading to delivery of performance analysis. \n-\tDuring USWEET 14 SSC PAC tested SWSS components in a production representative\/form factor node enclosure with the acoustic array to ascertain end-to-end autonomous processing in a production ready integration of hardware and software. \n\n-\tDeliverables:\n-\tA report of SWSS experimental observed results and detailed analysis of performance capabilities within 120 days following completion of the event. \n-\tPlanning meeting minutes and an updated action item register - within one week following all planning meetings. \n-\tOperation order and data collection and analysis plan 45 days prior to event start. \n-\tAfter action overview summary within 10 working days following receipt of all data. \n-\tFlag level briefings within 90 days of the event\n-\tA final report informing acquisition investment decisions within 6 months following completion of the event. \n\n-\tAccomplishments: Autonomous deployment, detection, and reporting of an undersea contact. Evaluated several emerging technologies showing potential to close warfighting gaps identified in the ASW and MIW IPCLs.\n\n-\tCampaign: Valiant Shield\n\n-\tFocus: Valiant Shield 2014 (VS14) is a bi-annual exercise focusing on at-sea training and experimentation for critical maritime initiatives. \n-\tVS14 is directed by U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), and NWDC is responsible for experiment design, data collection, and analysis for initiatives participating in this at-sea experimentation event. \n-\tParticipants include Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), ships and aircraft from the Navy and Air Force, program executive offices (PEO), coalition and allied partners, and multiple Navy commands. \n-\tStrict experimental design and controlled data collection efforts, including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, make VS14 a robust venue for the evaluation of technologies in an operational setting. The complexity of this experiment requires a skilled, highly experienced staff for planning, experiment design, data analysis, and reporting. Pacific Science & Engineering Group (PSE), having resident experience in the past 11 Trident Warrior experiments and in VS13, is considered uniquely and distinctly qualified to perform these tasks.\n\n-\tFunctions: PSE provided human-system integration (HSI) analytical, experimental, and human factors engineering services to support NWDC during experimental design, execution, analysis, and reporting of VS14.
