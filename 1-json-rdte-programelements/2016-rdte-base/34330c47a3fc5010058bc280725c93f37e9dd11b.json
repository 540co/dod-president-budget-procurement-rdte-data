            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (June 2012). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps)to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. It also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.\n\nAs a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare. Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts as well as methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&I) phases of Naval S&T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system\/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. \n\nIn addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  The UAEO technology gap is being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses the Sea Strike Capability Gap."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  Concurrent funding for Naval expeditionary warfare capability ECs is also provided from Navy PE0602750N and PE0603673N. Both of the Navy PE's were included in the FY 2013 President's Budget Request and are now the only Navy program elements funding Navy FNC work.

Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into five pillars:  deployment support, force closure, sustainment, reconstitution\/redeployment, and command and control.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.\n\nThe FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in the scope and size of anti-fouling and non-fouling water purification components to enable enduring performance of small water purification systems.\n\nThe FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to the initiation of the intelligent microgrid systems effort in support of Expeditionary Force-21."

This Thrust aims at capturing emerging and \"leap ahead\" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Beginning in FY 2009, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) efforts are funded under the Force Protection activity.  Presently, MCM supports and enhances the maneuver and force protection Marine landing forces with the development of technologies to enable detection, neutralization, breaching, and clearing of mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and unexploded ordnance from the beach exit to inland objectives.  MAGTF MCM is a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and includes Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Expeditionary Operations from a Sea Base, sustained Operations Ashore, Urban and Asymmetric Operations, and OOTW.\n\nThe FY 2014 to FY 2015 decrease in the Maneuver Thrust Activity is due to a reduction in scope of development of a vehicle demonstrator that focuses on enhanced crew survivability.\n\nThe FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in the Maneuver Thrust Activity is due to increased cost associated with development of a vehicle demonstrator that focuses on enhanced crew survivability."

Therefore, to accurately reflect enhanced synergy within the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&I), this project, 2297 (MCWL), was renamed FD.\n\nAs part of the DC, CD&I, the mission of the FD is to identify plausible future security environments and develop and explore warfighting concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).  It does this in order to identify potential future capability gaps and opportunities in order to inform future force development.  FD executes its' mission through three divisions:\n\nFutures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks.\n\nEmergent Force Development's (EFD's) mission is to:  explore select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges in order to guide development of Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS.  EFD is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.\n\nMCWL's mission is to:  explore and analyze Marine Corps service concepts using an integrated combination of research, modeling and simulation, wargaming, live force experimentation, science and technology (S&T) discovery, assessment and integration, and analysis in order to better understand how these concepts expose gaps and create opportunities for future force development.\n\nFD uses the following competencies to accomplish its mission:  \n\nWargames are conducted to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities.\n\nModeling and Simulation (M&S)-based events allow the FD to examine capabilities with larger scale venues and forces than is practical with live forces at lower cost in terms of funding and in terms of operating force personnel and equipment.  M&S also enables assessment of proposed capabilities before making investments in costly concept demonstrator technologies required in live force experiments. \n\nLive force experimentation permits exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  Experimentation encompasses inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  Combat Service Support (CSS) and Force Protection; Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.\n\nTechnology investigations, investments, and assessments are conducted to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL's S&T Division will investigate the relevance to Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21) capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  C4ISR, Autonomy and Robotics, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Fires, Maneuver, Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy), Expeditionary Medicine, Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW), and Force Protection. \n\nDC, CD&I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for S&T.  As Director FD, the Commanding General (CG) of the MCWL is the DC, CD&I designated Proponent of USMC S&T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&T.\n\nThe FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.\n\nThe current Futures Directorate Campaign Plan (FDCP) addresses  how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and CONOPS called for in the Secretary of the Navy's \"Cooperative Strategy 21\" and the Marine Corps' follow-on \"Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)\" concept.  The FD was created in 2013 to be the organization within the Marine Corps with the unique mission of anticipating future operating environments, determining the demands they will place on our naval services, and informing the capabilities development process on how to operate and maintain the tactical advantage in these environments.  In doing so, the FD makes recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  FD will pursue exploration of concepts that support flexible and sustainable MAGTFs employing distributed tactical formations across the range of military operations.  FD will also examine future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment for immediate crisis response."

Investments in this activity will be conducted under the Thrust Areas of Expeditionary Logistics, Force Protection, and Autonomy and Robotics.\n\nThe FY 2014 decrease in category funding is mainly due to a reduced contribution to the MCWL-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) legged robot effort, in addition to reductions in assessment of technologies that reduce the demand required to support the MAGTF.  FY 2014 to FY 2015 increases are mainly attributable to an increased emphasis on providing enhanced medical care over a distributed battlefield.  Other increases are due to expanded efforts in unmanned ground logistics delivery technologies."
