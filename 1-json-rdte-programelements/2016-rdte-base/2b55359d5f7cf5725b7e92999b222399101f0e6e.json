The Space and Missile Defense Command participated and supported biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continued to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples included: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continued to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.  Based on the successful evaluation of Air\/Event Information Sharing Services into NORTHCOM J6 decision support systems, we supported the transition of the application to a Joint Capabilities Technical Demonstration (JCTD).  Supported TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We sustained our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.  BC3 was upgraded to more realistically address information flows related to Close Air Support.  Continued fabrication and test of components to develop a test-bed for enhanced thermal management technologies supporting missiles\/TOCS\/shelters and other systems utilizing mobile thermal management in realistic operating environments. Selected components were integrated with battlefield applications to support demonstrations of projected efficiencies with identified enhanced thermal management technologies."

This is accomplished by participating in and providing support to Unified Quest wargames and experiments to analyze and integrate technology to identify the feasibility integration into Army space, missile defense, and high altitude systems.  The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space, space control, and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM. Will support TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We will sustain our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.  Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3) will be upgraded to more realistically address information flows related to Close Air Support.  Support MDA to Army BMDS element transition and transfer efforts including BMDS sensor deployments.  Develop\/defend Army requirements development \/ documentation to MDA spiral\/block development."
