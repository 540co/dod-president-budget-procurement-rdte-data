The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas for the following key components:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): Develops Naval BMD Capability \n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the non-Aegis portfolio including Targets, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Ground-based Midcourse Defense, and the Israeli programs\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter\n-Advanced Technology: Develops technology to counter future threats \n\nSBIR and STTR topic areas for FY 2014 included: \n- Secure and Survivable Electronics Software\n- Standard Missile 3 Materials Design Improvements\n- Track Refinement from Off-Nominal Break-Up\n- Command and Control Course of Action Analysis Tool\n- Innovative and Modular Open System Radar Algorithm Test Environment\n- Reconfigurable Memory or Central Processing Unit Instruction Architecture\n- Radio Frequency Field Sensor for Integrated Circuits \n- Mapping Debris Trajectories through a Fireball\n- Late-Time Sensor Characterization for Missile Intercept Debris\n- Innovative Data Architecture Generation Across a Complex System of Systems \n- Statistically Significant Simulation of the Ballistic Missile Defense \n- Development of High Performance Computing Technology for a Distributed Modeling and Simulation \n  Hardware Infrastructure\n- Innovative Solutions to Insensitive Munitions Fast Cook-off Environments and Testing\n- Weight Optimized Mitigation to Direct Effects of Lightning Strike on a Missile Body\n- Missile Avionics Architecture Insensitive to Transient Power Interrupts \n- Integrated Health Sensing for Highly Efficient Weapon Inspection and Sustainment\n- Variable Gravity Two-Phase Heat Sink for Airborne Directed Energy Systems\n- Robust Phase Modulators and Polarization Controllers for High Power Fiber Lasers\n- Enhanced Sensor Systems\n- High-End Tactical Grade Inertial Measurement Unit Technology for Missile Defense\n- Maturity and Durability Enhancement of Advanced Aerospace Materials\n- High Performance Long Wave Infrared Focal Plane Array Sensor for Missile Defense\n- Miniaturized Safe and Arm  Devices\n- Failure Avoidance in Microelectronics Due to Coefficient of Thermal Expansion \n- Base Metal Electrode Capacitor Test Methods\n- Measurement of Remaining Effective Stabilizer in Solid Propellants"

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\n \nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas for the following key components:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): Develops Naval BMD Capability \n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the non-Aegis portfolio including Targets, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Ground-based Midcourse Defense, and the Israeli programs\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter\n-Advanced Technology: Develop technology to counter future threats"
