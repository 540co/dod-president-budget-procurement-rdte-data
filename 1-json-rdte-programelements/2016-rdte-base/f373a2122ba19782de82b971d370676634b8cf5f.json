                            "val": "The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, space, cyber, ground, and surface domains in an environment for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force\/joint\/coalition partners.  This reaches 31 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nThe DMOC utilizes RDT&E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:\n\n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of Environment Generators and is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide red\/blue air and other capabilities.  The DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to facilitate a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events.  Future planned DMO Tool development includes enhancement & improvement of:  the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter; the Tactical Air Datalink Information-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J (Dr. J) tool which allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator communication formats; development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) which improves damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises and develops solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.\n\n2. Certification & Accreditation (C&A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&A and Networthiness of core systems.  It implements requirements of Cybersecurity and is working toward the application of the Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include test & evaluation of the Distributed Training Network Guard (DTNG), a DMOC\/NAVAIR partnership; accreditation work for various interoperability tools such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, and the DIS filter tool.\n\n3. Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems into LVC DMO training events such as VF and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment. New sites and systems are incorporated into LVC DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) emerging requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
