Due to Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency requirements, beginning in FY2015, all non-MAIS funds were transferred out of 0203726A into 0203728A.   Beginning in FY2015, JADOCS funding is justified in project code EF6 and AFATDS funding in project code EF8.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.

            "val": "There are three developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently: Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6); Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8). \n\nJoint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief\/recover operations worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS system\u2013to\u2013system interfaces enables automated communications with Joint and Coalition systems to minimize targeting process time and increase dynamic targeting accuracy. JADOCS coordination managers provide operators and commanders with a clear definition of the targeting cycle's workflow process steps, responsibilities and status. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows Operating System.\n\nPocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II will be a software only application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and contributes to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations.  PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.\n\nThe Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint\/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack\/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics\/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air\/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities."

Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application will be transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.\n\nThe PFED Increment II CPD, dated 6 September 2012, was approved as an \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" requirement. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue in order to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box.

Therefore, the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5, to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.

AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint\/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).\n\nAFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack\/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics\/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air\/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities. \n\nAFATDS FY15 funding in the amount of $17.722 million is for the continued development and testing of the AFATDS 6.8.X Software Release which will align with the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.  The COE has been directed by the AAE to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements.  \n\nNetwork Assisted GPS for Precision Fires (NA GPS) is a development effort to improve performance and mission reliability for GPS-guided munitions. Regardless of terrain-constrained operational conditions and GPS degraded environments, NA GPS will permit Precision Fires Mission availability. NA GPS is tailored to support standardized messaging with Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), AFATDS, M777A2 Towed Howitzer Digital Fire Control System and Mortar Fire Control System. Network Assisted GPS for Precision Fires will complete the developmental effort in FY15.\n\nFunding in FY16 through FY20 was moved from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), formerly known as AFATDS Increment 2. The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) decided that AFATDS Increment 2 was a software modernization effort instead of a new acquisition program. Project Manager (PM) Mission Command presented a Software Change Proposal for the current AFATDS as the appropriate approach to execute this effort. PM Mission Command will execute AFATDS software version 7.0 development effort as a continuation of the current AFATDS program. \n\nFY16 funding in the amount of $19.219 will be used to initiate efforts on AFATDS version 7.0. This will include preliminary design reviews for the application and architectural infrastructure, human factors studies, and contracting (Request For Proposal, contract award). Software development will reorganize and optimize the technical foundation to provide a more adaptable baseline to accommodate future Army Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements while maintaining Joint Command and Control (JC2) interoperability.  PM Mission Command will develop a role\/duty-based functional architecture (Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction) that reduces training workload and simplifies usage. AFATDS version7.0 will also provide embedded computer based training to decrease classroom burden and increase system usability."

PdD FSC2 fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 in September 2014 to maintain compatibility with the fielded Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) version 1.0.5.2. AFATDS version 6.8.1.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 3QFY2016. The PM projects that AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), will achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.\n\nBased on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  The PM will re-design AFATDS version 7.0 to provide the operator role\/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The PM will competitively award this contract for this effort in 3QFY2016 with fielding projected for FY2019.\n\nDevelopment of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board."
