This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.\n\n\u2022  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.\n\n\u2022  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer intern programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU\/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts."
