Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration\/modernization funds support the following Air Force test organizations and their associated test and evaluation facilities, including:  remote locations, 96th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 96th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, the 412th TW at Edwards AFB, CA, 96 TG Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Hypersonic Wind Tunnel 9 at White Oak, MD, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at Moffett Field, CA.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Installed a backup set of slip rings for the Central Inertial and Global Positioning System Test Facility 3-Axis Tables (Axis 1 and 3 on 53Y) to meet test support requirements and to mitigate risk should the current slip rings fail during test support.  Continued upgrade of the Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) 168i Dynamometer control and data acquisition system.  The computer used for this system is obsolete (early 1990's vintage) and replacement parts cannot be easily acquired.

The 120 Dynamometer test system is essential to the continuation of the LGTF's aircraft tire testing mission."
