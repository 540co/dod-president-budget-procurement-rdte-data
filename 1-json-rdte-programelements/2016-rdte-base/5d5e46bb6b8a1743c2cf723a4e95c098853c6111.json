These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft.
