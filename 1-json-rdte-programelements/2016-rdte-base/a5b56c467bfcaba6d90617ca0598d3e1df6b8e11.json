The T&E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team's State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the Enterprise Maturity Model (EMM) and shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time. \n \nThe T&E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity.  In FY14, of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, & Computers\/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases.  One DCGS PoR has completed interoperability testing, and the joint IOP certification is pending.  The remaining two PoRs are not required to be JS J6 certified, but the T&E FT leverages data collected during periodic IOP assessments of these programs during enterprise-level demonstrations and test events.  Due to increased automation for data collection, parsing and analysis, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year.  This trend is expected to continue in FY15 and FY16.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supported by the DCGS Governance."
