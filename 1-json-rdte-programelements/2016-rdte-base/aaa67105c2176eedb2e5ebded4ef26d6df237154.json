This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. \n\n(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar\/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.  It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.\n\n(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program.  The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental effects between shipboard transmitters\/receivers and develops EM and spectrum techniques with Commercial off the shelf (COTS)  technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage and system EM degradation on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capabilities in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment for planning purposes.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain."

Develop new testing capabilities\/revised software capabilities at the Naval NSWCDD Naval Ordinance Transient Electromagnetic Simulator (NOTES) EMP Facility (ashore test bed) to meet MIL-STD-2169C threat levels.  Conduct analysis and test & evaluation on a statistically valid sample of Transient Protection Device (TPD) to establish performance\/degradation criteria.  Develop in-situ methods for determining TPD performance that can result in development of new Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRCs) to be implemented by the Fleet. Current MRC's do not specify when TPD's should be replaced."
