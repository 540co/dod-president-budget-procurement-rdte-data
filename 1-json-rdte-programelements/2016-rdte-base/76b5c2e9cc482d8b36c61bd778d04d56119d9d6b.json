Through the use of state-of-the-art semantic processing and advanced techniques in computer data analysis, human-generated semi-structured employment artifacts have been compared to collected sensor data in order to adjudicate the collection effectiveness across required time, area, and intended utility for multiple sensor modalities. Resultant metrics and associated metadata have been stored in an enterprise database, which can be exported to support both current and future analyses. \n\nThe S&T Advisor provides expert engineering and technical assessments on a wide range of ISR topics, establishes and maintains interfaces with the senior scientific and technical directorates within USD(I), the military services and the Combat Support Agencies and integrates ISR Operations technology roadmaps with related program plans and initiatives."
