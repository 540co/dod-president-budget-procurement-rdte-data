To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.

This sub-project also oversees development of non-nuclear warhead technologies to defeat time-sensitive targets for near and longer-term CPGS applications.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components. This activity will support both ground and flight tests, and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.\nThe objectives of this sub-project are to: \n- Assess boost-glide technologies in light of ground and flight test events and associated modeling and simulation.\n- Analyze the military utility of multiple, 3-axis stabilized vehicles performance with respect to thermal protection materials, aerodynamics and control surfaces, navigation, guidance, control (NG&C), boosters, and weapons performance.\n- Assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.\n- Continue systems definition\/engineering\/development of integrated weaponized payload delivery vehicles and subsystems in order to identify and reduce risks and mature technologies for a potential extended range acquisition program."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of  industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of  industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of  industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2016, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."
