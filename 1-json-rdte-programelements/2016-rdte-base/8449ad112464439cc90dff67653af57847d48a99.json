            "val": "The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services."

To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g. loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.

The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and to demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to provide high-power spatially resolved EW beams at frequencies utilized by adversary communications and radars.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single platform could support.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  Further, the ReACT system must sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area to be jammed, as well as the minimum power required to sufficiently jam the target.  The ReACT program builds upon technology developed under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program, which is budgeted in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and will culminate with a flight demonstration of distributed EW beamforming.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy."

In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep-ocean sonar nodes will be developed to operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  At-sea demonstrations have shown that the detection capability is achievable.  The program will continue to develop prototype systems that will evolve through additional at-sea testing.  These tests will demonstrate the ability to integrate into the Navy's undersea systems responsible for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).  The program seeks to achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy."

The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas which were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  By leveraging techniques explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program within Project NET-02, the Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea energy and data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment and sustainment technologies. The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Navy."

Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.\n\nThe Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution by leveraging the powering and performance results from the previously funded Super-Fast Submerged Transport program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: integration of reliable undersea connectivity, autonomy, guidance, and navigation; obstacle avoidance; and propulsion and energy systems compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements.  The program will culminate in a series of at-sea demonstrations and will transition to the Navy."

Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  Building upon concepts explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program within Project NET-02 and the Upward Falling Payloads program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03 the Long-Range Undersea Navigation program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus triangulate its position.

Threat ASCM capabilities and lethality are rapidly improving with extended range, higher speeds, and advancing sophistication in navigation and targeting subsystems.  In addition, these weapon systems are being proliferated in greater numbers to adversarial nations with options for submarine deployment.  Submarine-launched ASCMs pose an even greater challenge to our Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems as they expand search area requirement proportional to the square of the cruise missile range.  The Multi-Axis Protection of Surface Ships program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of these threats through the development of advanced offboard sensing from unmanned systems.  These multi-spectral mobile and autonomous sensor systems will operate at significant offboard ranges from maritime battle groups to provide tactically significant early warning of cruise missile attacks.  The effort is focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size (SWaP), to enable unmanned vessel implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods and sensor modalities leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  Provided compelling detection capability is achievable, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program seeks to further explore ASW and networked maritime system concepts explored within PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, and PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, to develop breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust autonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.

This program demonstrated the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program enabled the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.
