Hyperspectral, multi-spectral, interferometric synthetic aperture radar sensors, advanced target and image exploitation software will be developed.  Additionally, efforts will be directed toward the development of advanced multi-mode Electroptic\/Infrared (EO\/IR), multi-mode MTI\/SAR radar, foliage penetration radar, multi-spectral\/hyperspectral imageries (MSI\/HSI), MASINT on-board fusion and registration, and cueing of the EO\/IR\/SAR\/HSI imaging sensor.  \nThe Hyperspectral Longwave Imager for the Tactical Environment (HyLITE) is the next generation airborne day\/night hyperspectral reconnaissance sensor for the detection and identification of camouflaged and concealed targets in all terrain environments.  Design improvements will be implemented and flight testing conducted to assess system performance."

EMARSS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify\/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS aircraft will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB). EMARSS is an improvement over the existing Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System Quick Reaction Capability (MARSS QRC).\n\nThe Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for EMARSS is 36 systems, the Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 24 systems and includes the following variants: EMARSS-G (Constant Hawk & TACOP LiDAR); EMARSS-V (VaDER); EMARSS-M (Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA)); and EMARSS-S (Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) systems.\n\nThe modification and conversion leverages the following QRC systems: Constant Hawk (5); LPA (8); TACOP LiDAR (3); and VaDER (4) redeploying out of Afghanistan to meet the EMARSS Capabilities Production Document (CPD).\n\nEMARSS Payloads will consist of Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and Processing Exploitation & Dissemination commercial derivative equipment such as, an Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensor with Full Motion Video (FMV), a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection system, an Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) system, tactical line-of-site (LOS) and beyond line-of-site (BLOS) communications suite, two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations and a self-protection suite.  Payloads integrated on platforms will include: niche capabilities such as Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS), Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) radar capability.   \n\nEMARSS will operate in direct support of tactical missions.  EMARSS, integrating elements of the DCGS-A, will provide a near real-time response to Combat Forces with Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) tasking.   \n\nFY 2016 RDTE funding in the amount of $3.532 million funds the product enhancement, sensor engineering support, and test and evaluation."

The acquisition strategy supported by the EMARSS CPD includes design and testing of 24 MEP\/PED systems and leverages proven Quick Reaction Capabilities for SAR\/MTI, LIDAR, WAAS, FMV and COMINT.  \n\nThe EMARSS acquisition strategy capitalizes on significant existing investments in AISR systems by hosting proven, mature (i.e. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or greater) sensors, communications subsystems and DCGS-A compliant workstations into a commercial derivative aircraft.  All systems are based on the B350ER platform and leverage aircraft modifications and sensor integration previously conducted on other Army and Joint programs.  The acquisition strategy supported by the EMARSS CPD includes design and testing of 24 systems.   As a result of Congressional language contained in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Army will forgo additional production of Boeing built EMD aircraft and will fulfill the end-state requirements of 24 systems by leveraging QRC platforms and modifying them into CPD compliant systems.  The EMARSS Program of Record (POR) will ultimately be comprised of four variants: (4) Boeing EMDs \/ EMARSS-S, (8) CH and TACOP\/LiDAR \/ EMARSS-G, (4) VaDER \/ EMARSS-V and (8) Air Force Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA) \/ EMARSS-M AISR systems.  The Air Force LPA aircraft transitioned to the Army 4Q FY14.  The four EMARSS-S (EMD) systems will be brought to a production level configuration and available for fielding.  Milestone C (4QTR2014) permits the induction of the 20 QRC systems into the EMARSS POR."

ARL-E payload procures the hardware, software, and infrastructure to rapidly install sensors which support a rapid plug and play, quick connect\/disconnect, mounting system to allow the installation of various combinations of sensor-types in support of a wide-range of theater operations. The sensor suite will consist of a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) subsystem capable of supporting theater net centric geo-location efforts, High Definition Full Motion Video (FMV); Improved Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI) radar capability and updated mission workstations, as well as radio and data\/communications architecture. ARL-E will leverage existing sensors as well as integrating and installing niche sensors to augment current capabilities. Niche capabilities include Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyper Spectral Imaging (HSI) sensors. The ARL Modernization Program standardizes the payload systems, upgrades the COMINT subsystem for improved Irregular Warfare tactical collection and geo-location, enhances the Full Motion Video (FMV) system with a High Definition capability, and improves the Synthetic Aperture Radar \/ Moving Target (SAR\/\/MTI) capability.  The modernization program ensures continued ARL relevancy against current and emerging threat emitters and tactics across the full spectrum of operations.\n\nARL-E Payload is funding the development and testing of the Long Range Radar (LRR) to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to meet the increased performance requirements of the Appendix J Payload for ARL-E approved CPD.LRR effort will add required SAR modes, address obsolescence, IA issues, and improved probability at greater required ranges. Effort will produce a prototype and flight testing to characterize the prototype performance. Funding is also planned for test and evaluation of LRR capability integrated in ARL-E system."
