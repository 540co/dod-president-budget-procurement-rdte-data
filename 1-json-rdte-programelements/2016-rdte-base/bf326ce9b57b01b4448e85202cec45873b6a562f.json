The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."
