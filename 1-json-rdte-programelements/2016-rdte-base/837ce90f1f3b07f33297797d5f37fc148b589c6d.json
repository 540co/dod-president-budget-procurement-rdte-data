These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP); integration and interoperability of capabilities. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability, informing acquisition decisions, and ensuring that Services and Agencies field integrated and interoperable systems.  The emphasis of JFIIT efforts is the analysis of C2 information systems and supporting procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event\/venue exercises.  In FY 2016, this legacy USJFCOM PE will be consolidated along with PE 0604787J (JSIC) and PE 0607828J (JII) into a single new Joint Staff PE 0604826J \u2013 Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Integration (JC5I).\n\nIn FY2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments."
