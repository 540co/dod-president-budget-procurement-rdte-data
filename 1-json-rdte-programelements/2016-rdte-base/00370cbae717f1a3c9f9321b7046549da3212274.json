Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal pressure to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department. This effort requires additional funding to increase the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources. The Air Force is completing its current wargaming cycles and charting a new course to better integrate and synergize the wargaming efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process. Specifically taking the current two Title 10 wargames and creating two Concept of Operations wargames, one Materiel wargame, and experiments as needed to match the SP3 process and cycles. Also represent the Air Force at other services and Joint wargames as they ramp up across the department. These efforts will make the difference between wise and unwise investment trajectories and make our forces more successful in future conflicts.\n\nThe Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives. The WIE is a deployable standalone Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three dimensional visualizations & mapping and services. Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off the shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame. The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions and all the wargame to executed but also documented. Allowing for findings to quickly surface during the wargame and be noted and allowing post-game analysis. These findings Inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making. At the conclusion of the current wargaming cycle, the current version of the WIE will need major overall to match the new charter and SP3 process along with supporting greater number and more diverse wargames. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
