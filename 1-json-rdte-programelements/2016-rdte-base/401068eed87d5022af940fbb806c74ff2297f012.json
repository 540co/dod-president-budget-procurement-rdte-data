The Lincoln Laboratory Program supports these missions by conducting research and development in nine science and engineering disciplines:\n- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of devices and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) systems.\n- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal plane arrays, integrated imagers, laser communications, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.\n- Radio Frequency (RF) Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive radio frequency (RF) sensors, development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies, and system concepts and communication systems.\n- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which includes the development of novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. \n- Cyber Security, which includes the development of technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.\n- Biomedical Sciences and Technology, which supports the development of technologies to aid the warfighter, to investigate relevant research in brain and cognitive sciences, to develop engineered biological systems, and to assess physical performance and injury recovery.\n-  Autonomous Systems, which includes the development of technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms, sensors and algorithms that support key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications.\n- Quantum System Sciences, which develops basic technologies that support sensing, communication and computation using quantum information, focusing on the demonstration of scalable computation platforms, demonstration of quantum protected communications and magnetic field sensing using highly-compact, atomic-like defects in diamond.\n- Novel and Engineered Materials, with emphasis on new materials for additive manufacturing and emerging nanoscale materials.\n\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:\n- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  \n- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts."

The quantum computing modalities include superconducting qubits and trapped ions, with both of these efforts focusing on the most forward-looking technology developments in their fields.  These developments include record coherence times using scalable, gate-based architectures for superconducting qubits and the development of integrated photonics for scalable arrays of trapped ion qubits.  New FY 2014 externally-funded efforts now support important companion technology development in both of these quantum computing modalities.  The FY 2014 quantum communication work included theoretical efforts to understand the cryptographic security of quantum protocols and experimental efforts to develop single-photon detectors and entangled \/ single photon generators that offer record speed and efficiency.  Finally, ensembles of nitrogen vacancies (atomic-like defects) in diamond were operated in a new geometry based on total internal reflection within the diamond to achieve the highest magnetic field sensitivity yet demonstrated for a diamond-based magnetometer.  All of these quantum sciences efforts are closely connected to work on MIT campus through collaborations that involve both the MIT faculty, who are world-experts in these fields, as well as their graduate students who work collaboratively in both locations.  As part of this collaboration, a 40-kilometer-long dark fiber link was established between MIT campus and MIT Lincoln Laboratory to enable future quantum communication demonstrations."

The trapped ion work will continue to support integrated photonics for more scalable systems and will develop gallium-nitrite-based waveguides and modulators suitable for the wide range of wavelengths necessary to address the ions, these broadband optical devices will also be suitable for classical applications, including undersea imaging and communications.  The quantum communication work will move towards improving a new protocol for high-rate, quantum-protected communication that avoids the need for a separate, slow key exchange step.  Finally, the diamond magnetometer work will move from single axis measurements to full vector measurements and will adapt protocols from other quantum modalities to further increase the sensitivity of the sensor.  Efforts to connect with MIT campus will be further strengthened and quantum communication protocols will be implemented over the fiber link."
