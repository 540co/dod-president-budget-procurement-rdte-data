            "val": "The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)\/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.\n\nThe JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:\n\n\u2022  Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.\n\u2022  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.\n\u2022  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today\u2019s conflicts.\n\u2022  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.\n\u2022  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.\n\u2022  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.\n\u2022  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2022  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD, and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 50 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  For FY 2014 it is projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes will have accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The total CPU hours represents an eight-fold increase from FY 2012.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons, including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.\n     -  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n     -  CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n     -  The Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.\n     -  The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2022  New munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129\/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association, recognizing significant contributions to the development, introduction, or support of precision strike systems.\n\u2022  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2022  The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC), and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).\n\u2022  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2022  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2022  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2022  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. \n\u2022  Characterization and analysis of the Army\u2019s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.\n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 33 current JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.\n\nThe JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:\n\n\u2022  Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.\n\u2022  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.\n\u2022  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today\u2019s conflicts.\n\u2022  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.\n\u2022  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.\n\u2022  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.\n\u2022  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2022  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD, and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 50 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  For FY 2014 it is projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes will have accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The total CPU hours represents an eight-fold increase from FY 2012.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons, including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.\n     -  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n     -  Cheetah, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n     -  The Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.\n     -  The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2022  New munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129\/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association, recognizing significant contributions to the development, introduction, or support of precision strike systems.\n\u2022  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2022  The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC), and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).\n\u2022  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2022  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2022  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2022  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. \n\u2022  Characterization and analysis of the Army\u2019s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.\n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 33 current JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.\n\nBoth Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.\n\nThe Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.\n\nThe desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.\n\nThe Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.\n\nThe specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area are:\n-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.\n-  Insensitive munitions and surety.\n-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.\n-  Micro and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.\n-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.\n-  Reactive processes in energetic materials.\n-  Development of tools for energetic material performance characterization.\n-  Explosives chemistry and properties, and new energetic materials formulation.\n-  Thermal response of energetic materials.\n-  Electromagnetic response of energetic materials."

Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department\u2019s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. \n\nThe miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.\n\nThe specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:\n\n-  Firing Systems Technology, comprising FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.\n-  Safe, Arm, Fuze and Fire Technology, comprising Initiation and Detonation, and Advanced Firing System Components.\n-  Advanced Initiation Systems, comprising diagnostics development, microdetonics, miniature initiation systems, and detonators for enhanced safety.\n-  Thermal Battery Performance Modeling to develop a multi-physics modeling capability for thermal batteries.\n-  Thin Film Thermal Batteries (new start for FY 2015) to develop, mature, and transition a method to produce a thin, conformal, low-cost thermal battery.\n-  Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) sensors for proximity fuzing of munitions.\n-  Enabling Robust, Mode-Agile GPS-Denied Weapon Guidance through High-Efficiency Data Processing (new start for FY 2015)."

In recent years there have been significant increases in warhead performance directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department\u2019s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. \n\nThe goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny\/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.\n\nThe specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area are:\n\n-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.\n-  Dynamic behavior of sand.\n-  Integrated munitions modeling & experimentation.\n-  Modeling of strategic structures subject to ballistic impact or blast.\n-  Concrete perforation and penetration modeling and experiments.\n-  Explosive\/metal interactions.\n-  Structure, mechanical & shock-loading response, and modeling of materials.\n-  Controlled effects warhead materials."

Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and\/or components.  These objectives are achieved by:  identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.\n\nThe specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:\n\n-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.\n-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.\n-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.\n-  Complex system health assessment."
