There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or award to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system\/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system \"mission proven\" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  There are multiple technologies being explored by DTRA, thus, this is a continual product improvement effort to enhance filtration.  The JSGPM ARPI effort will investigate alternative designs and modifications to ZZAT (Zirconium hydroxide, Zinc, Argentum (Silver), Triethylene di-amine (TEDA)) to further increase filtration of TICs and Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA).  ZZAT is a zirconium hydroxide based filtration media that can potentially be layered with carbon.  The first technology, known as Cobalt-Zinc ZZAT (CoZZAT), uses a layered bed of carbon concept to improve TIC and CWA protection capabilities, while the second technology known as Metal Organic Framework (MOF), is an engineered media that is a porous crystalline compound made up of metal ions and organic bridging molecules (ligands) for targeted removal of chemicals."

This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nJEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box \"IT Box\" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The \"IT Box\" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document released early in the program.  \n\nIT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 Interim to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MSB) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority that covers the entire program.  MSB is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs), delegated to Joint Project Manager Information Systems, associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  \n\nAs software-intensive systems, both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost\/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC\/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.\n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.\n\nAs part of this strategy, JEM program office developed and issued a competitive prototyping contract in April 2013 where two offerers were given the same Technical Data Package (TDP), performance Work Statement (PWS), and software requirements and were tasked to deliver a JEM prototype that implements the CCMI architecture.  This competitive prototyping strategy\nwas successful and a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in December 2013. \n\nThe current contractor for JEM 2.0 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) document produced by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO).  The JRO will release RDPs-2, 3, and 4 over the next three years prior to contract completion.  It is anticipated when the contract is re-competed in FY18 that there will be four of five capability drops not yet developed under RDP-2 and two of five under RDP-3.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will be responsible for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JEM follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.\n\nThe JEM IS ICD describes the notional implementation plan for fielding of future JEM capabilities among four separate JEM Requirement Definition Packages (RDPs).  RDP-1 contains the baseline capabilities for software and was released in June of 2014.  RDP-2 will be released after the completion of RDP-1.  This RDP will incorporate emerging capabilities that the Joint Science and Technology Office determines has reached a sufficient enough maturity for incorporation into JEM, such as ability to model new agents.  Requirements to integrate baseline capabilities into a version that can be fielded on service C2 systems will be released in RDP-3.  RDP-3 will be released following RDP-1 but prior to RDP-2, to rapidly allow baseline capabilities to be incorporated into C2 systems.  RDP-4 is a notional package that would allow the Science and Technology community a venue to use the JEM program to develop a version of the product for S&T use.  Capabilities that are only required for the Science and Technology community and not for operational users would be implemented in RDP-4.  Capabilities in RDP-4 would not be required to go to Operational Test, as they would not be fielded to operational users. \n\nRDP 1 - Baseline Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 1.\nRDP 2 - Emerging Capabilities: There are 5 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 2.\nRDP 3 - C2 Integration: There are 8 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 3 tied to all the various Strategic and Service C2 Systems\nRDP 4 - Analytical Support: There are 2 planned Capability Drops (CD) within RDP 4.\n\nAfter an over-arching MS B with the MDA, each RDP will have an associated Build Decision.  Each CD will have an associated fielding decision.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 utilizes the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services."

By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2016 will focus on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays as well as laptop retrofit and fielding.  Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  The operational development RDT&E funds will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence.\n\n\nThe NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 (NGDS Inc 1) will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  BA7 funds will be used to complete the development of assays initiated during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase and needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as fund the development of three objective assays (Burkholderia, Alpha Virus, and Orthopox)."

The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe term \"Role\" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evaluation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  The NGDS Inc 1 program has a streamlined MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy.  The NGDS Inc 1 is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  NGDS Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) will complement NGDS Inc 1 by developing diagnostic capabilities for biological pathogens and toxins and address diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.\n\nNGDS Increment 2 will conduct technology development FY14-FY16 prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be informed by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 4QFY14.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Increment 1 to expand the breadth and depth of diagnostics to CBR threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics, and far forward echelons of care.\n\nMB7 funds will support development, testing, and FDA approval of additional assays after system fielding."
