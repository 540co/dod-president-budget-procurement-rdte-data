The development and application of simulation technology will provide the means to link electronically a range of various simulation tools in a manner that is transparent to the user.  The amalgam of simulations and tools is linked together to enable execution of an event; to verify the scenarios, tactics\/techniques and procedures; to train testers on new hardware\/software; and to conduct trial test runs before costly live field tests.  The tools developed are available for reuse by developers and users of simulations throughout the Army.  \n\nProject C74 provides the resources necessary to perform the formally chartered mission of the Army's Simulation-to-C4I* Interoperability Overarching Integrated Product Team (SIMCI OIPT).  (*C4I = Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence.)  Project C77, Army Geospatial Data Master Plan, focuses on activities that start with data acquisition from multiple sources and culminate in (1) accurate, robust and timely geospatial data and data management and (2) integration and conversion tools that support multiple battle command, training and mission-rehearsal applications.  Project C78 develops the One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) program, which will combine and improve the functionality and behaviors of several current semi-automated forces to provide a single SAF for Army use in simulations.  \n\nFY 2016 funding for Project C74 continues management of the SIMCI OIPT's Army-wide collaborative, interoperability enhancement activities, including architecture alignment, data model alignment, common standards, components, and products. Project C77 continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model(GGDM) and Geospatial Data Standards.  Project C78 continues development of software as required to provide OneSAF Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is) as prioritized and approved by the Training and Doctrine Command."

The SIMCI OIPT mission is to provide policy recommendations to Army senior leadership to improve organizations by allowing Soldiers to fight in the same manner in which they train. This is accomplished by interoperability between Mission Command (MC) systems and the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) systems the Army uses to stimulate MC systems for training Soldiers and their Leaders. SIMCI also invests in targeted solutions to critical problem areas that exist between MC and Simulations. The SIMCI OIPT, led by Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (STRI) and PEO Command Control Communications-Tactical (C3T), uses focused collaborative processes among its 30+ Army organizations to identify key\/critical interoperability shortfalls and the required materiel solutions.\n\nThe SIMCI OIPT provides the following: (1) Advisor to Army Leadership--improve MC and M&S interoperability programs, policies, directives, resourcing, and procedures; (2) Technical Investment--sponsor\/support initiatives that seek common solutions to critical interoperability issues surrounding MC and M&S systems; (3) Outreach--conduct & participate in interoperability outreach activities. SIMCI investments consist primarily of cost-sharing initiatives, leveraging initial system solutions of acquisition programs to enhance the interoperability of multiple systems in the Joint Operational Environment. SIMCI investments accelerate implementation within MC and M&S systems, of common data models and information exchanges that are used by other Services and coalition nations, thus enhancing the inherent ability of Army systems to interoperate seamlessly in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environment.  \n\nFY 2016 funding continues management of the SIMCI OIPT's Army-wide collaborative, interoperability enhancement activities, including architecture alignment, data model alignment, common standards, components, and products. It is focused first on reducing costs and improving capabilities in the areas of automating Operational Plans, Orders, and Reports in support of Army, Joint, and Coalition operations.  Objectives are: identify and articulate to HQDA senior leadership specific standards that require Army-wide implementation; co-develop data standards, architecture standards, implementation specifications and Joint\/Coalition products; continue transition of SIMCI knowledge and proof-of-principle products to Army and Joint acquisition programs."

The AGDIMP provides the framework for generating, analyzing and distributing geospatial data for battle management operations, training, and mission rehearsal.  The AGDIMP also provides the procedures for identifying and refining Army geospatial resource requirements.  Geospatial data provide soldiers with the framework and background for displaying the location of friendly and enemy forces and the location of other critical features on the battlefield.  Geospatial data -- used in Army command and control systems, course of action analysis, mission rehearsal tools, simulators and simulations -- provide insights on how the physical environment will impact combat operations.  This minimizes exposure of soldiers to hostile environments.  The AGDIMP describes the operations for a complete, integrated network-centric enterprise for managing and updating geospatial data required for the Army's Future Force.  Although this plan encompasses most of the issues of an enterprise solution for geospatial needs and concerns, it does not contain the full level of detail or complexity required to be considered complete.  The AGDIMP includes all activities starting with data acquisition from multiple sources (including raw sensor feeds from national sensors to soldier\/platform level) and concluding with accurate, robust, and timely geospatial (terrain-related) data management, integration, and conversion tools that support multiple battle command, training, and mission-rehearsal applications.  The AGDIMP does not include the algorithms and functions used by the applications themselves to produce finished battle command or intelligence products.  The AGDIMP will become part of a much larger effort to integrate geospatial activities across all Services while documenting the complex framework for a \"net ready\" geospatial information and service architecture, an environment in which the Army's current and future forces must operate to achieve information dominance within the total battle space.  This larger effort is currently being developed in conjunction with the Joint Forces Command and the other Services, including Special Operations Command.\n\nFY 2016 funding continues development efforts associated with the Ground-Warfighter Geospatial Data Model(GGDM) and Geospatial Data Standards."

OneSAF is fully interoperable with the Army's emerging virtual, live, and division-and-above constructive simulations and provides next-generation simulation products. OneSAF replaces a variety of legacy simulations used within the Army to support analytic and training simulation activities.  \n\nFY 2016 funding allows for continued development of the software product line by addressing OneSAF Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3Is) as prioritized and approved by the OneSAF Project Office - Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This funding also provides for the management of the infrastructure, equipment, laboratories, and processes needed to develop the required product baseline."

The key objectives here are to develop the capabilities needed to execute the OneSAF production line and deliver OneSAF SW product line, data, and documentation to meet the needs of the growing user community.  These software products will include capabilities supporting the requirements of the OneSAF program; other US Army PEOs and PMs, TRADOC Battle Labs, Research and Development Centers (RDECs) and agencies; other Service and Joint agencies; Foreign Countries; non Department of Defense government organizations and agencies; academic institutions and other Co-Developers. \n\nThe I2S Delivery Order is primarily focused on the Configuration Management and Control of the released OneSAF Product Line and executes the overarching OneSAF integration, interoperability and support efforts required for delivery of OneSAF SW, data and documentation products to the User Community.  It also provides the Conceptual Modeling, Architectural and Engineering support to the OneSAF Co-Developers as required to support their OneSAF SW product deliveries; the training products and support required by the OneSAF user community; and integration of capabilities. \n\n\n."
