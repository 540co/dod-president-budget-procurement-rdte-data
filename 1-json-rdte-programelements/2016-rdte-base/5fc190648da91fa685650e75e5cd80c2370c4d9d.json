AFATDS is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint\/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack\/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics\/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air\/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities. \n\nJoint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination, and de-confliction mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area.  JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute dynamic and Time Sensitive Targets as well as planned targets and fire missions. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military as well as enabling common system information exchange to coordinate, collaborate, and de-conflict missions. The JADOCS' system\u2013to\u2013system interface enables automated communications with Joint and Coalition systems to minimize targeting process time and increase dynamic targeting accuracy. JADOCS coordination managers provide operators and commanders with a clear definition of the targeting cycle's workflow process steps, responsibilities and status. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces supporting time sensitive and dynamic targeting, battle space coordination, search and rescue, and disaster relief \/ recover operations worldwide. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire Joint force. Mission Summary windows display the coordination and targeting status of each mission using intuitive color coded indicators referred to as coordination status. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows OS."

PdD FSC2 fielded AFATDS version 6.8.0.1 in September 2014 to maintain compatibility with the fielded Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) version 1.0.5.2.  AFATDS version 6.8.1.1 remains under development with a Full Materiel Release projected for 3QFY2016.  The PM projects that AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), will achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.\n\nBased on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  The PM will re-design AFATDS version 7.0 to provide the operator role\/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The PM will competitively award this contract for this effort in 3QFY2016 with fielding projected for FY2019.\n\nDevelopment of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board."

The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).\n\nAFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack\/Engagement Analysis, Fire Support Planning, Mission Guidance, Target Definition, Mission Area Definition, Cross-System Graphics\/Mapping management, Unit Task Organization Data, Fires Conflict Detection, Mobile Air\/Ground Tracking, Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  \n\nAFATDS FY15 funding in the amount $1.273 million will support efforts to finalize AFATDS V7.0 requirements through market studies and contracted research, and contracting efforts (Request For Information, Request For Proposal, Performance Work Statement, etc).\n\nFunding in FY16 through FY20 was moved from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163), formerly known as AFATDS Increment 2. The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) decided that AFATDS Increment 2 was a software modernization effort instead of a new acquisition program. The AAE determined that AFATDS Increment 2 reflected a modernization of the software code for the current AFATDS Project Manager (PM) Mission Command presented a Software Change Proposal for the current AFATDS as the appropriate approach to execute this effort. PM Mission Command will execute AFATDS software version 7.0 development effort as a follow on to the current AFATDS program."

AFATDS version 6.8.1.1, the final software improvement under the superseded AFATDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), is projected to achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 4QFQ2016.\n\nBased on the approved AFATDS Increment 2 Capability Development Document (CDD) (CARDS # 04031), the Army Acquisition Executive approved the development of AFATDS version 7.0.  This is a modernization of the existing software code to meet the approved key performance parameters as well as meet Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards.  AFATDS version 7.0 will be re-designed to provide the operator role\/duty-based interaction with a dynamic embedded training capability, as well as allow for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.  The contract for this effort will be competitively awarded with fielding projected for FY2019.\n\nDevelopment of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board."
