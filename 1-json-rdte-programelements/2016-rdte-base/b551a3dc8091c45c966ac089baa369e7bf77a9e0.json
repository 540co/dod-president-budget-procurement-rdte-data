Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.\n\nThe Mixed Technology Integration project funds advanced development and demonstrations of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of activities funded in this project include, but are not limited to:  (1) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital; photonic and electronic) or mixed substrate (Gallium Nitride, Gallium Arsenide, Indium Phosphide, or Silicon Germanium with CMOS) technology that will substantially improve the capability of existing components and\/or reduce size, weight and power requirements to a level compatible with future warfighter requirements; (2) development and demonstration of brassboard system applications in such areas as laser weaponry or precision navigation and timing to address mid-term battlefield enhancements; and (3) novel technological combinations (i.e. photonics, magnetics, frequency attenuators) that could yield substantial improvement over current systems."

Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications.   Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT is advancing both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.  Successful realization of Micro-PNT requires the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and development of miniature inertial sensors based on atomic physics.  Innovative microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  The program is developing miniature inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.

The BEAST program provided additional tools for the military community, conducted cognitive testing in high risk service members, and expanded the current knowledge base of the impact of blast exposure by correlating physiological and behavioral changes with direct measures of blast-exposure.  Ultimately, these results contributed to the TBI and PTSD knowledge base for improved treatment, developed enhanced understanding of blast events to mitigate exposure and improved training procedures, and aided in completing the transition of the Blast Gauge device to military service sustainment."

Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity\/density, respectively).  The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride (GaN), InP, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoC) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.\n\nThis program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage these complementary efforts to focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers."

The size, weight, and power (SWaP) will be consistent with weight and volume densities needed to support the integration of laser weapons on a broad range of Military platforms.  To accomplish these ends, FLASH will (1) greatly reduce the overall size and weight of packaged coherently-combinable high-power fiber laser amplifiers while greatly simplifying the demands they make on support systems such as cabling, cooling lines and support structures while increasing their efficiency and resistance to shock, vibration and acoustics and (2) fabricate an array of these ultralight fiber-laser amplifiers and integrate them with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems into a transportable, fully packaged laser system."

For example, Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) Bipolar Complementary Metal-oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes allow CMOS logic to be integrated with radio frequency (RF) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), which enables mixed-signal circuits having RF analog capabilities tightly coupled to digital processing.  However, the SiGe process flow was developed to integrate to a single CMOS technology node and significant design and engineering effort is required to retarget the flow for a new node.  Thus, BiCMOS processes tend to lag behind commercial CMOS by several generations.  This program will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology, i.e. one that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN) and SiGe with a standardized interconnect topology.  Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, with a goal of re-use of the IP across applications.  Re-use will allow the DoD to amortize the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single chip systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, FAB will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a handful of traditional prime performers.\n\nIn the Advanced Technology Development part of this program, focus will be placed on the development of rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing III-V semiconductors and other microelectronic technologies with advanced Si CMOS.

RLG\/iFOG is the technology of choice for high-value platforms.  However, for the vast majority of platforms (munitions, dismounts, UAVs), CSWaP necessitates the use of lower-performance MEMS-based IMUs.  Under the micro-PNT program, DARPA has developed MEMS gyroscopes with performance rivaling that of navigation-grade interferometric fiber optic gyros (IFOGs), thus exposing a new tradespace for low-CSWaP navigation grade IMUs.  The PRIGM program will advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of state-of-the-art  MEMS inertial sensors from TRL-3 to TRL-6.  The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a complete MEMS-based navigation-grade IMU with an identical mechanical\/electronic interface to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, thereby providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems and rapid transition to TRL-7. \nThis program has applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

However, the rate of development and level of integration in microwave and mm-wave magnetic components have severely lagged the corresponding advancements and monolithic integration of semiconductor, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and optical active devices.  In some cases the magnetic technologies have changed little in the past 20 to 30 years.  The Microwaves and Magnetics program will leverage advanced magnetic components leading to disruptive improvements in system performance and novel functionality.\n\nA particularly attractive magnetic component for front-end receivers is FSL. An FSL is a device that automatically attenuates high power signals above a certain threshold while allowing low power signals at different frequencies to pass.  Use of FSLs will enable receivers to operate in the presence of strong interferers providing wideband protection, enable operation in congested RF environments, and increase effective dynamic range.  Corresponding advances in other magnetic components and technologies will dramatically improve the performance, and increase the integration level of transmitters and receivers for Department of Defense (DoD) applications.

These cameras allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera can be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  The imager chips were fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera has wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.
