It performs systems engineering activities in collaboration with the Services, Joint Staff, and OSD.  The JSET reviews Service Program of Records (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs.  It recommends engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and\/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements. The JSET scope encompasses the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats.  Activities included studies and analysis that support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThe objective of the JSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service PoRs and MDA systems.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks: \n- Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.\n- Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical\/performance requirements.\n- Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities.\n- Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.\n- Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.\n- Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the JSET.\n\nBA 6 - This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
