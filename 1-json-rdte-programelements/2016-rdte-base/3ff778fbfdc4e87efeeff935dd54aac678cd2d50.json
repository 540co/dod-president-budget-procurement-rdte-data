            "val": "The intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threat that endangers the United States is projected to make significant progress over the next decade in: quantity of threats; rapid launch time line with no warning; and complexity with the use of countermeasures. To counter this evolving threat, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is adding key Homeland Defense capabilities to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) (i.e., Long Range Discriminating Radar (LRDR) and Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD)) and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV).  The RKV will address the following three areas:  design to the evolving threat for increased performance; improve reliability, availability, maintainability, testability, and producibility; and increase in-flight communications to improve usage of off-board sensors information and situational awareness to combatant commanders for enabling improvements in tactics such as shoot-assess-shoot.\n\nIn FY 2016, three significant events are planned: a Preliminary Design Review (PDR), a Critical Design Review (CDR) of key components, and long lead purchases to provide a fully qualified and integrated RKV for a controlled flight test in FY 2018.  To support a FY 2018 test, the Program will perform a CDR for those components requiring the longest purchase lead time.  In FY 2016 the long lead material will be purchased. RKV subassemblies driving long lead procurement include the kill vehicle sensor and propulsion systems.  Long lead components to be procured include the focal plane array, sensor optics, structure, thrusters and associated tooling.  Procurement of these long lead components in FY2016 is required to support component and sub-assembly development testing as well as the FY2018 flight test. In addition, consideration of kill vehicle components from multiple technology offerings are to be evaluated at the design reviews allowing the government to select the best components. The two design reviews and material purchases in FY 2016 are reasons for the increase in requested funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016. In addition to concept development, government costs, and pre-contract costs, only one quarter of full effort for development will be on contract in FY 2015 versus a full year in FY 2016.\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

To counter this evolving threat, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is adding key Homeland Defense capabilities to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) (i.e., Long Range Discriminating Radar (LRDR) and Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD)) and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV).  The RKV will address the following three areas:  design to the evolving threat for increased performance; improve reliability, availability, maintainability, testability, and producibility; and increase in-flight communications to improve usage of off-board sensors information and situational awareness to combatant commanders for enabling improvements in tactics such as shoot-assess-shoot.\n\nMDA is conducting market research, completing Material Solution Analysis and is developing the RKV Acquisition Strategy.  MDA is completing the RKV requirements documents to support a development contract award in FY15 that will follow a robust acquisition and systems engineering approach following the MDA acquisition management policies and processes which are tailored to DoD 5000.02 regulations."

The Agency will redesign the kill vehicle (RKV) to keep pace with the threats to the U.S. homeland. The RKV will be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces and standards, making upgrades easier and broadening our vendor and supplier base. The design for growth allows future upgradability. Eventually, the new RKV will replace the kill vehicle on our current GBI fleet.\n\nOverall, the RKV will be developed to improve: reliability, maintainability, producibility, survivability, affordability and testability. The RKV will be designed to utilize the enhanced capabilities being developed in the Long Range Discriminating Radar (LRDR) and Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD).  The redesign will improve performance to meet emerging threats and will maximize the operational capacity of the GMD weapon system. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of capabilities to improve BMDS reliability, lethality, and discrimination. The end result will be a deployed future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a reentry vehicle.\n\nThe Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) acquisition strategy The RKV acquisition strategy will include a best-of-breed design approach where possible with the Government as the design authority responsible to ensure overall RKV design and development integration.  The Government will implement rigorous systems engineering processes and use Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and University Affiliated Research Centers in support of the design and development.  The MDA intends to award a development contract for the RKV in FY 2015, with a goal to field in 2020."

This provides integrity and oversight of the BMDS as well as supports MDA in the development and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation and, provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations.
