Funding will provide additional work towards ongoing testing and analysis efforts within the Combat Systems Integration, AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, Antisubmarine Warfare Integrated Common Processor\/Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Insertion, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module development and other major acquisition programs. In addition, funding will support the development of guidance to facilitate NAVSEA-affiliated programs' adoption of this TOC-reducing discipline and technology.\n\nStarting in FY2016 and through the out-years, the project has been renamed Automated Test and Analysis (ATA). ATA will extend the use of automated test methods currently in use such as Automated Test and Re-Test, research new methods of testing and use of automated test technologies, and standardize test practices, methods and tools across the Naval Enterprise.   In addition, funding will support the development of enterprise level strategies to apply ATA to the software-intensive acquisition programs, establish standards, specifications, and guidance, as well as use business case analysis to select future pilot projects and applications.\n\nThe ATRT project is funded on Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88: \"Automated Test and Re-Test\".
