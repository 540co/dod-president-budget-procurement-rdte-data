            "val": "The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program is researching, developing, integrating, testing, deploying, operating, and maintaining a CWMD situational awareness system.  This system will enable a comprehensive, global capability for situational awareness of threats from WMD as well as global efforts to counter those threats.  This system will foster a shared understanding of the CWMD operating environment and support decision making for operations and activities by the U.S. government and its partners.  The CWMD mission space is characterized by immense amounts of information, such as the characteristics and location of WMD-related facilities and materials, personnel and expertise, and dual-use technologies.  The CWMD Systems program comprises next-generation advanced information technologies, coupled with small fusion cells, to locate, gather, access, share, and visualize this WMD-relevant information to facilitate collaboration and decision-making. These solutions will revolutionize CWMD knowledge management, providing decision makers and operational personnel a dynamic, holistic view of the global CWMD operating environment.\n\nThe diversity and complexity of the CWMD mission requires an integrated approach toward capability development, based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The CWMD mission is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense and hence system development must leverage and integrate complementary technologies developed to support other mission areas. The CWMD Systems program also will enable international collaboration in countering WMD by breaking down unnecessary data stove-pipes and by enabling the U.S. Government and its partners to access and share knowledge.\n\nThis program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategy for Countering WMD, the FY2016-2020 Defense Planning Guidance, and capability requirements approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The CWMD Systems program will develop and field a global CWMD situational awareness capability to meet the needs of Combatant Commands, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and Defense Agencies.  Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will be able to utilize this capability to support their mission needs and collaborate with the Department of Defense. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver an operational capability. \n\nThe CWMD Systems portfolio is supported by two RDT&E program elements (0303310D8Z for research, development, testing and evaluation of advanced materiel and non-materiel solutions, and 0607310D8Z for upgrades or improvements to fielded systems), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) line (ORC 2531) for program sustainment and administrative costs associated with analyses, oversight, and portfolio management.     \n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."
