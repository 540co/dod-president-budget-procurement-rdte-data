            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents.  For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E), these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, 2006 National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. \n\nA focused and strong WMD threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA\u2019s combat support mission.  DTRA's has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n\nActivities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support the prevention and adversary use of WMD through the development of technology to locate and identify nuclear threats, post-detonation forensics, and treaty verification.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental Counter-WMD (CWMD) research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems, and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund the development of tools for the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center which supports United States and allied forces, interagency, and civil authorities with 24 hour\/7 days per week Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support."

The advanced analytics program provides systems engineering and R&D with requirements, technology, architecture analyses, and proof-of-principle capabilities necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, R&D investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts R&D to investigate, identify, develop, and transition short term, high payoff technologies from the DTRA, other government agencies, industry, academia, and international Science and Technology (S&T) partners into DTRA's, and others R&D programs, and to end user organizations.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of WMD events to warfighters and first responders in consult with the DTRA\u2019s CWMD R&D subject matter experts.  Net-centric modeling access and support provides a real-time accessible framework which enables DTRA's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Modeling & Simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of CWMD decision support capabilities.  This project also provides support to international CWMD S&T cooperation including the development of modifications and improvements to new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts.  Other research activities via analysis and engagement include collaborating with scientific, technical, and social science faculty\/experts to help understand and anticipate future WMD capabilities.  This effort also provides management and support of the Threat Reduction Advisory Committee which provides independent expert advice to the Secretary of Defense on CWMD.  \t\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to increased investment in advanced analytics, modeling and simulation (M&S), and hazardous effects characterization while reducing investment in systems engineering collaboration with external partners\/customers.

Starting in FY 2016, detection-related technologies transition to Project RD (Detection Technologies).  Project RF includes Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats. This includes weapons, material, and enablers to their acquisition, and development such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique technologies. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counter\/nonproliferation, and homeland defense.\n\nThe increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to increased investments in both nuclear detection Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance efforts and nuclear forensics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This project achieves its goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons delivery systems for rapid WMD elimination.  This project includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Counter-WMD (CWMD) technologies.\n\nThe project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in component demonstrations and sub-scale and field testing of WMD defeat and assessment technologies."

                            "val": "The Nuclear Survivability project provides innovative technologies for DoD nuclear and conventional forces, associated control and support systems, and facilities to protect and deter nuclear threats to enable mission-essential functions to continue during and after the onset of hostile action by extremists and rogue states. The Nuclear Survivability project provides electromagnetic pulse (EMP) research and standards, Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation, advanced Radiation Hardened Microelectronics (RHM), and human survivability research.  The research from this project supports the 487 mission critical systems identified under DoDI 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.\n\nDTRA is the DoD designated EMP center of excellence to provide electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments to support national and military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and national strategic system designs.  DTRA publishes nuclear related military standards and handbooks for the strategic and non-strategic warfighters and program offices as the DoD NWE subject matter expert.\n\nThe RHM program responds to DoD space and missile system requirements for nanoelectronics and photonics technology to support DoD strategic mission needs.  This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype microelectronics to ensure their availability from both private sector and government organizations. Further, the program develops DoD space and satellite nuclear survivability standards and handbooks that provide engineering level detail and defined metrics for all entities with space asset equities.\n\nPulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Experimental Capabilities Program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom's (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n\nHuman survivability conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapons effects in urban environments.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation\/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics.  The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of the system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects to Project RI."

The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model and simulate weapons effects on WMD and related targets.

The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed, and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/Hard and Deeply Buried Targets. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics.  The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to decreased investment in weapons effects modeling."

It leverages 50 years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The project provides capabilities that support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard and Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the cancellation of the Infrastructure Development and Improvement program to balance priorities."
