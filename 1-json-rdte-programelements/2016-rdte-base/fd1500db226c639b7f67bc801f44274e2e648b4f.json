            "val": "The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy.  CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.\n\nFY 2016 core funding of $.749 million for CCTT enables gaming technology and visualization for maneuver training, and the P3I for the CCTT, to include virtualization and other Better Buying Power in order to reduce life cycle costs.\n\nFY 2016 base funding of $2.999 million for Games for Training will provide for modifications to the Games for Training (GFT) system to ensure compliance with the Live, Virtual, Constructive\/Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) in support of Unified Land Operations.  It will also integrate new commercial and Government technology products into the current gaming system. \n\nFY 2016 base funding of $16.658 million will continue the efforts of providing expanded development of the capability to produce common terrain databases.  FY 2016 funds will modify the Terrain Development process to include constructive terrain databases, continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture and generate databases for constructive simulation and gaming.  Maintaining OneSAF for virtual simulations enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) and is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they that do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs). SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks.\n  \nFY 2016 base funding of $1.216 million will complete the development and testing the Voice Communication System capability. The required software will allow Army Aviators to properly communicate to internal and external entities in support of Aviation Collective Training Tasks."

The GFT program satisfies the Active, the National Guard, and the Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo-specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. GFT comprehensively trains Platoon and below formations.  GFT trains higher echelon units and staffs without troops.  \n\nFY2016 base funding of $2.999 million will integrate the GFT flagship product into the Live, Virtual, Constructive\/Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE). It will also integrate new commercial and government technology products into the current gaming system."

                            "val": "This project supports the Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) Program.  SE Core's mission is to ensure the Army's training systems and simulators are integrated and interoperable in support of U.S. Army Readiness. SE Core provides virtual simulators with visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic to Unified Land Operations.  The result is a \"Fair Fight\" capability; no simulator or operator will have an inherent advantage over another.  Fair Fight allows for air and ground to have coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations.  Additionally, SE Core is building the Army's Common Virtual Environment (CVE) that provides the linkage between simulators and establishes a common environment for interoperability, allowing various simulators to be linked together for a train-as-we-fight capability. SE Core is a foundational element in the Integrated Training Environment linking the embedded systems, multi-mode Live, Virtual, Constructive, Gaming (LVCG) training capability with current systems.\n\nThe SE Core components are Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) integration; terrain database production; common visual models; virtual systems architecture; a dynamic environment; and mission command development.  A major SE Core component is the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) process used to produce the synthetic terrain used in simulators and simulations.  This terrain is a key component for virtual simulators and constructive simulations and will meet the demands of today's and future simulations.  \n\nFY 2016 base funding of $16.658 million will continue the efforts of providing expanded development of the capability to produce common terrain databases.  FY 2016 funds will modify the Terrain Development process to include constructive terrain databases, continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture and generate databases for constructive simulation and gaming.  Maintaining OneSAF for virtual simulations enables interoperability with the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) and is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they that do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs).  SE Core will continue to upgrade, integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components, and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks."
