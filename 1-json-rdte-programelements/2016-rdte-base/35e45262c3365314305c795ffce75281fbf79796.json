Specific activities include the following:\n\n- Work with MDAP\/MAIS\/SI Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&E Organizations to develop a comprehensive DT&E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones.  Ensure that the test strategy beginning at Milestone A, is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.\n- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.\n- Provide formal DT&E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. \n- Participate in Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams.\n- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and \nCybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).\n- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments, with respect to developmental test and evaluation, and identify needed changes or \nimprovements to such organizations and capabilities. Provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan \ndeveloped by Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).\n-As the T&E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification \nstandards to enhance T&E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum \nsupports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training."
