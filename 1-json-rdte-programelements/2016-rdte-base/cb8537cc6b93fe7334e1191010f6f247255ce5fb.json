            "val": "Discrimination Sensor Technology develops solutions to improve identifying, acquiring, tracking and discriminating incoming Ballistic Missile threats, supporting the US Strategic Command's Prioritized Capabilities List.  Areas of concentration include advanced detectors, infrared sensors, focal planes and algorithms for ground, sea, air and space systems. Sensor technology enhances both the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) capability to develop precision tracks and the ability to discriminate lethal objects among the incoming threat cluster. \n\nThe Discrimination Sensor Technology (DST) program funds the demonstration of Aegis LoR real time stereo tracking with MTS-Cs integrated into MQ-9 Reapers. Aegis LoR is the capability that allows Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) to launch an interceptor before its own radar acquires the threat, greatly expanding the space where the Aegis BMD can intercept the threat and significantly extending the defended area. In Fall 2014, the Agency conducted a campaign at the Pacific Missile Range Facility with Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems (MTS) equipped MQ-9 Reapers specifically modified to accomplish missile defense tracking missions. The MDA tested MTS-B variants aboard MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and MTS-C variants on the ground at Makaha Ridge for Flight Test X (FTX-20) and Flight Test Standard Missile 25 (FTM-25). Both tests were executed using the BMDS operational architecture proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile - 3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne MTS sensors.  \n\nThe MD95 DST project funds the prime contract integration and system test, checkout flights, and performance analysis. DST incrementally builds on the airborne MTS-B launch-on-remote demonstrations using airborne MTS - C sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reaper UAVs.  The DST program will demonstrate the increased Electro Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) capability of MTS-C airborne sensors for precision track launch-on-remote and discrimination over MTS-Bs as a precursor to advanced sensor equipped MTS-C prototype development and test under the Technology Maturation Initiatives PE.  \n\nThe MT95 DST Flight Test Execution project funds the costs associated with MTS-C\/MQ-9 Reaper participation in BMDS testing including prime contract test execution, MQ-9 operations and maintenance, and Enterprise Sensors Laboratory (ESL) and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) interfaces. \nThe Missile Defense Agency collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the United States Navy and the United States Air Force in a systems engineering based strategy to research, develop, test and evaluate DST. The DST test program include Air Force provided F-16 aircraft for use as surrogate targets and sharing of MTS-C test data between the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Air Force to augment sensor characterization activities.  \n\nThis technology  significantly enhances the following Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) priorities:\n\n- Precision track of multiple objects to enable missile defense components to engage-on-remote\n- Discriminating lethal objects from countermeasures\n- End-to-end correlation of sensor track and discrimination data\n\nThe Discrimination Sensor Technology program element development and test results directly feed sensor prototype demonstrations in the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element (0604115C). \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

This program evaluates and researches emerging technology that enables game changing discrimination improvements for incorporation into next generation interceptors and air or space systems. The DST program pursues a cost-effective incremental upgrade philosophy that demonstrates airborne precision tracking and improved track performance and discrimination. These advanced sensors improve the probability of engagement success for stressing threats, expand the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) battle space and increase the ability to negate larger raid sizes. \n\nThe MD95 Discrimination Sensor Technology project funds the prime contract integration and system test, checkout flights, and performance analysis.   \n\nIn Fall 2014, the Agency conducted a campaign at the Pacific Missile Range Facility with Multi-spectral Targeting Systems (MTS) equipped MQ-9 Reapers specifically modified to accomplish missile defense tracking missions. The MDA tested MTS-B variants aboard MQ-9 Reaper UAVs and MTS-C variants on the ground at Makaha Ridge for Flight Test X (FTX-20) and FTM 25. Both tests were executed using the BMDS operational architecture proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile - 3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne MTS sensors.  \n\nIn FY 2016, DST incrementally builds on the MTS-B launch-on-remote demonstrations using airborne MTS - C sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reaper UAVs.  The DST program will demonstrate the increased Electro Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) capability of MTS-C airborne sensors for launch-on-remote and discrimination over MTS-Bs as a precursor to advanced sensor equipped MTS-C prototype development and test under the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element.  \n\nMDA's sensor technology construct incrementally buys down risk by testing an evolving sensor technology from the ground and then from UAVs and uses measurement of repeatable Resident Space Objects (RSOs) and targets of opportunity to characterize performance before participating in BMDS tests to collect performance data under realistic conditions.  Discrimination Sensor Technology interfaces with the existing BMDS architecture to develop 3-dimensional (3-D) tracks of the ballistic missile, which are sent via Link-16 to Aegis ships for engagement."

Aegis LoR is the capability that allows Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) to launch an interceptor before its own radar acquires the threat. Aegis BMD LoR involves Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) providing information about the paths (called tracks) of ballistic missile threats, to Aegis BMD from forward based radars. It expands the space where system can intercept the threat and the defended area. The DST flight test program leverages other BMDS tests as an associated operation to gather sensor data. \n\nIn FY2015, the Missile Defense Agency successfully tested two MTS-B sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reapers. The DST tests were executed using the BMDS operational architecture proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile - 3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne MTS sensors.\n\nIn FY 2016, the DST Flight Test program tests two MTS-Cs integrated into MQ-9 Reapers to demonstrate increased track precision and discrimination capability for the BMDS.  As a precursor to the BMDS testing, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is partnering with the Air Force to characterize MTS performance. The tests demonstrate readiness for BMDS testing and provide data that feeds Air Force Air Dominance development planning.\n\nThe DST Flight Test Program funds flight, operations and maintenance costs, as applicable, for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations and ground support equipment. It also funds shipping of the test assets to test ranges, labor, travel, range support and Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) test support specific to DST. \n\nThe results from this airborne MTS-C LoR test sequence mature the critical technologies necessary for prototype development under the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element (0604115C).  LoR is the precursor to Engage-on-Remote (EoR), which significantly expands BMD reach and the defended area. Under the Technology Maturation Initiatives program, advanced sensor equipped MTS-Cs will demonstrate the performance improvements EoR from Airborne sensors provides the BMDS."
