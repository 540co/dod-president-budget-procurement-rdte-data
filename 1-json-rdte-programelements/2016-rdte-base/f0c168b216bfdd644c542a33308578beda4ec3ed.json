Analyses include operations research methodologies such as statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. OAD analysts often develop novel tools and solution methodologies to accomplish the mission.  Recent innovations in analysis of amphibious operations, Irregular Warfare (IW), and Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) serve as examples of OAD expanding the state-of-the-art in operations research methods.  These tools are employed to assist the Commanding General (CG), Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) in his mission of creating and maintaining combat-ready Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTFs). OAD is also the Marine Corps authority on previous analytical work done throughout the Joint Analytical Community, and leverages emerging methods and findings to solve problems facing the Corps.  The division's primary mission is to support decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel and training management decisions, equipment acquisition, and resource allocation.\n\nOperations Analysis Division(OAD), Current Operations Analysis and Support Team (COAST) is responsible for providing deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Regional Command Southwest C-5 Assessments and the Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa CJ-3\/5\/7 Assessments teams in Afghanistan and Djibouti, respectively.

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.\n\nThe decrease in funding from FY15 to FY16 reflects the re-phasing of development funds to better align with the revised program development schedule."

The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs.  This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  \n\nPhase A activities \"jump start\" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative puts resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest. Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives."
