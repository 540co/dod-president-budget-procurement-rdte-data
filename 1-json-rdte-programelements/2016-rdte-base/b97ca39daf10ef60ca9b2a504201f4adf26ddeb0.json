            "val": "This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force. Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems. The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, NY and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

In addition, the Air Force requires technologies to deliver a full range of options in cyberspace on par with air and space dominance in each of the areas of cyber-attack, cyber defense, and cyber support to achieve the strategic capability of cyber dominance. This project provides the technologies required to successfully deter any adversary from attacking computer systems anytime, anywhere by ensuring the Air Force's ability to: access, maintain presence on, and deliver effects to adversary systems; detect, defend, and respond to attacks on friendly computer systems as well as provide forensic analysis concerning those attack attempts; and provide cyber situational awareness to Air Force commanders."

Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.  In addition, the Air Force requires the development of superior, intelligent, on-demand computing to enable information superiority.  Technology development in this project focuses on producing: computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing constrained, dynamic mission objectives; \"game-changing\" computing power to the warfighter; disruptive computing power at the tactical edge and for federated grid services; and interactive and real-time computing improving the usability of high-performance computing to the Air Force.

Since the site is a single-purpose location not located on a military installation, the Information Directorate has unique requirements for supporting its S&T mission.  As the host unit, the directorate is responsible to provide the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, NY and provide for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission.  Operations include: logistics and communication services, utilities, maintenance of facilities and structures, safety and security of the workforce and visiting researchers, and ensures compliance with the laws, regulations and directives that pertain to site operations.
