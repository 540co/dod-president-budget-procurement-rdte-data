Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.\n\nDLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community. All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II selections will be strongly influenced on future market possibilities and commercialization potential demonstrated."
