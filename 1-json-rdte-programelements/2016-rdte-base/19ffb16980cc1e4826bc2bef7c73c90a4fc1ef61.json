The account underwrites limited-scope analyses, experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.  This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and suggest affordable solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.  JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Though a relatively modest program, JWP is consistently cited by joint combatant commanders\u2019 staffs as the seminal infusion of funding that spawned insightful demonstrations, theater centers of excellence, mission essential capability modifications and strategic concepts.

JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.

Update ISR module tables to additional Joint Capability Areas (JCAs), design DECRI interfaces and automated data feeds, and conduct detailed DECRI system and warfighter\/Combatant Command (CCMD) user assessments. Plan and execute an analysis for Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) Transport Infrastructure.  Several CCMDs, specifically SOCOM, CENTCOM, AFRICOM, and PACOM, have documented issues with how the current and projected AISR Transport Infrastructure falls short of meeting operational needs.  The CBA will be developed in accordance with JCIDS processes through a working group led by AT&L, Joint Staff, and DoD Chief Information Office (CIO), and will include the Services, the CCMD, USD(I), and several agencies.  Material gaps identified in the Capability Based Assessment (CBA) will be used to develop an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that could support an Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and subsequent program start."

Joint warfare independent analysis often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  These resources leverage a small analytic framework (currently consisting of analysts at the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA), and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)).

Project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."

Evaluation data for individual experiments was shared with the technology provider and early indications are that more than 75% of these organizations change their products based on this government feedback.\n-Conducted in JIFX detailed cyber and Radio Frequency (RF) vulnerability assessments of 23 emerging technologies providing thorough and realistic potential adversarial assessment of a single technologies and a system-of-systems early in the technology development cycle.  This information was provided to CCMDs in the form of technical reports for use in requirements development and is available for acquisition decision-making. Early data suggests that more than 90% of these technology providers change their products based on this feedback.\n-Initiated development of a risk evaluation strategy for cyber effects to inform FY16 Platform Resilience and Mission Assurance analytical agenda.\n-Developed a cyber-vulnerability mitigation strategy typology that complements DoD's Risk Management Framework. \n-Examined mission priorities and criticality of systems (weapon systems and tactical communications systems) based on Department planning scenarios as a precursor for evaluating cyber resilience.\n-Initiated alignment of cyber effects to missions to determine potential risk, opportunities, impacts and implications as a precursor to inform cyber resilience roadmaps.\n-Completed a review of analytical approaches being used (or could be used) to identify key cyber terrain in both fielded weapon systems and systems at various stages in the acquisition process."
