Projects may include techniques and methodologies that improve detection sensitivities, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), tagging and tracking technologies, data analysis tools, and global situational awareness.  Efforts will support the DoD\u2019s Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction by developing and demonstrating active and passive defenses that address both known threats and potential surprises in adversaries\u2019 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) technology and employment methods, particularly those that could present challenges to existing countermeasures.  The constant evolution of WMD materials, tactics, and technologies calls for the development of flexible and innovative solutions that leverage the full range of DoD and interagency tools and capabilities.  Capabilities that support these tasks include detection; modeling; detailed operational planning; and analysis of materials, precursors and agents that may be related to a proliferation activity, an adversary\u2019s developmental or fielded capability or the actual use of WMD.  Prototypes developed in this focus area will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as Thunderstorm integration exercises and the Joint Experimental Range Complex (JERC).  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics."
