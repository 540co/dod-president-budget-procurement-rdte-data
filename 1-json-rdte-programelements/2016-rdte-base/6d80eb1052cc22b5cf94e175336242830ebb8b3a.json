The Agency acquisition strategy ensures that the GMD components are upgraded to improve both system performance and interceptor reliability in order to retain the proven GMD contribution to the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). This acquisition approach minimizes the risk of parts availability, provides opportunities for incremental capability improvements, and allows decision makers to make informed trades between cost, schedule, and performance while exploring improved operational and technological capabilities. \n\nGMD awarded a competitive Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC) on December 30, 2011. This contract continues development, fielding, test, systems engineering, integration, and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and upgrade; training, operations and sustainment of the GMD system and associated support facilities. The DSC emphasizes the application of performance-based tenets to provide timely high quality support of the core GMD system while reducing life cycle and long-term ownership costs. GMD's acquisition strategy for transition of the legacy content into the DSC provides uninterrupted field operations; development of both Ground Systems and Interceptor (GBI) products, including manufacturing additional interceptors to support both operations and testing; and the requirement to demonstrate war fighting capability through a rigorous ground and flight test program."

This provides integrity and oversight of the BMDS as well as supports MDA in the development and evaluation of technologies that will respond to the changing threat. Additionally, PWS includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation and, provides facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations.  Other MDA wide costs includes:  physical and technical security; civilian drug testing; audit readiness; the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program; legal services and settlements; travel and agency training; office and equipment leases; utilities; data and unified communications support; supplies and maintenance; materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment; and similar operating expenses. Program Wide Support is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total adjusted RDT&E profile (which excludes:0305103C Cyber Security Initiative, 0603274C Special Program, 0603913C Israeli Cooperative Program and 0901598C Management Headquarters)."
