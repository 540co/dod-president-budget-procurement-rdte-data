            "val": "The Defense Technical Information Center\u2019s (DTIC) unique mission is to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable access to essential research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) information, supporting all DoD users.  DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, is the DoD\u2019s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  Over the past several years, DTIC has evolved to an information delivery house, that through use of the internet, can deliver technical information nearly instantaneously to all DoD users.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security and Information Systems, and Homeland Defense and Security.  DTIC captures, preserves, protects, shares research and development (R&D) information assets, and encourages collaboration to connect user communities.  DTIC seeks to provide a department level mapping of R&D activity.  This activity and its results advance research by providing researchers, warfighters, research and engineering (R&E) management, and decision makers with insight into current and past research conducted, highlighting progress made and by whom, and, just as important, where research leads to dead ends.  As new capability needs are identified, technical challenges arise--rather than starting anew--work can pick up from the point of most recent results.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investment, DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&E community, DTIC works to connect researchers across the lab enterprise, to include research and engineering, warfighters and DoD\u2019s industry partners.  DTIC operations focus on five key areas:\n\n1) Document and preserve what works, what has promise (for reuse and additional investments).\n2) Provide results that identify dead-ends that do not merit additional investment (avoid waste).\n3) Facilitate and encourage engagement among cross-cutting communities of interest (bring together experts across the acquisition enterprise to meet warfighter needs).\n4) Present overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).\n5) Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC\u2019s stewardship (protect information access).\n\nDTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of the services and products we provide in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions.  DTIC has reduced its physical footprint, civilian personnel and contract support; restructured the IAC program; and continues to consolidate its data center.  At the same time, DTIC has taken on additional programs, to include its new role in leading the Department in efforts to provide public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data and increased outreach to industry through the Defense Innovation Marketplace.\n\nDTIC continues to ensure its activities are efficient and effective, meet users\u2019 expectations, and employ industry best practices and standards, while protecting from cyber threats.  DoD\u2019s $120 Billion annual investment in research, development and procurement, support current and future capabilities.  The results of these efforts are a national asset that DTIC must preserve for reuse across the acquisition enterprise.  Approximately 23 percent of the four million records in DTIC\u2019s information holdings are sensitive DoD only, federal government only and industry proprietary.  DTIC is the only enterprise source for both publicly accessible and DoD sensitive material in a single location.\n\nDTIC\u2019s Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office provides core funding, management and oversight of its three IACs.  The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  The IAC program just completed a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to the current three, reducing customer costs and incorporating new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings, to include Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems.  As part of the Department\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative, new multi-award contracts have been put into place, improving competition, small-business presence, and reducing government costs.  The restructured IAC Program will improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs.  Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts, DTIC\u2019s IACs perform nearly $2.0 Billion of customer funded research and prototyping support annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of material in DTIC\u2019s information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g., Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).  \n\nThis Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on core mission, and buys space, human resources (HR), financial management, contracting, IT security and communications, and civilian payroll services from expert and efficient DoD providers:  funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training, professional development, and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and HR services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications and IT security services; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies, equipment, hardware\/software; and support contracts for information technology services, Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts in concert with the Department\u2019s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) program.  In addition, this PE provides funding in support of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, in accordance with Public Law 111-251 (Small Business Reauthorization Act) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act. Within the PE, an annual set-aside contribution totaling approximately $400,000 is provided to the DoD's Commercialization Pilot Program, as directed by the Department's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP)."

This change represents a departmental restoration of DTIC mission funding.  The FY 2016 funding increase directly provides for the following efforts:\n\n- The Department\u2019s activities associated with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements for public access and open digital data for research efforts.  OSTP policy requires increased public access to the results of federally funded scientific research, including peer reviewed journal articles and digitally formatted scientific data.  The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) is the lead agency for DoD\u2019s implementation and compliance.  \n\n- On-going DTIC activities--that would otherwise be suspended--needed for DTIC to meet DoD information technology security and identity management requirements, as well as efforts to expand content available to warfighters and other DTIC users on secured networks.  \n\nPublic Access:  The Department\u2019s efforts associated with public access and open digital data provides for a broader collection of technical data, improving access and availability for both DoD and public users.  The scope of the public access initiative expands beyond DTIC\u2019s current mission areas (Budget Activities 6.1 to 6.3) to cover all research performed in the Department.  This government-wide effort encourages further reuse of technical data, and is expected to drive innovation, efficiencies and cost savings to users.  Additional funding in support of the public access & digital data initiative will provide for the following activities:\n\n- DTIC will increase its public access services (services that had been slated for curtailment as a result of previous budget reductions), enhance our research in progress summary database, collect and store manuscripts of peer reviewed journal articles, and develop tools to link public users to journal articles and relevant digital data.\n\n- It is critical for DTIC to bolster its IT systems and infrastructure supporting the central repository for scientific and technical data.  New automated processes will allow for efficient processing and placing of up to 40,000 additional journal articles online per year, a tenfold increase over the current volume, providing access to DoD and public users.\n\n- Establish a compliance system and process linking DoD resources to research, enabling DITC to track and collect all results generated from grants, contracts and in-house work, to include work published in peer-reviewed journal articles."

                            "val": "DTIC is responsible for developing, coordinating and enabling a strong scientific and technical information (STINFO) program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) and the DoD scientific & technical (S&T) enterprise.  In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&E) community.  DTIC\u2019s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.\n\nRecognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results.  DTIC employs technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.\n\nDTIC is leading the Department\u2019s efforts to implement public access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers.  In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services, components, other federal agencies and publishers.  Consistent with the Administration\u2019s (Office of Management and Budget) emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to WebService Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard data submission and machine readable delivery.  DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress.  DTIC employed this same technology in collecting S&T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and Independent Research and Development (IR&D) data from industry.  DTIC is planning the migration of completed technical reports collection to the same open standards \u2013 machine readable formats.\n\nThrough the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides an industry leading search capability that links its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata to support both text searches and data mining.  DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.\n\nWith the September 2014 full operating capability (FOC) release of the commercial product based R&E Gateway, DTIC provides the means to connect 60,000+ members in the acquisition enterprise (DoD Labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), Program Executive Offices, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) and Combatant Commands (CCMD)).  In an access controlled environment all of DTIC\u2019s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions.  DoD conducts research at its 60+ labs, in the FFRDC\u2019s, DTIC\u2019s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), through contracts and grants, and across over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest; this work is available through the R&E Gateway.\n\nTo protect information, DTIC maintains a database of registered users; in addition, DTIC utilizes commercial software and follows DoD Identity Management Standards, providing Common Access Card (CAC) users instant authenticated access.  DTIC is working with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to give users more control of their online profile and extend immediate access to federal government employees and contractors holding valid credentials. \n\nFocus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, NIPRNET, SIPRNET and Internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.\n\n- DoD\u2019s Acquisition Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to ASD(R&E)\/AT&L, DTIC\u2019s priority is the acquisition enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNET (the primary network for the community).\n- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the acquisition enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts a subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNET.  DTIC is working to expand the availability of S&T information, to include Independent Research and Development (IR&D), on the SIPRNET.\n- Industry and Academia via Internet:  Engaging industry outside the NIPRNET \u201cfirewall\u201d to support Better Buying Power initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified \u201cpublic\u201d information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet.  The Public Access initiative adds importance to the public distribution point, to encourage technology transfer of basic and public research to the private sector, and to give an economic boost to small businesses that can use that data to provide new applications to consumers.\n\nSummary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD\u2019s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the acquisition enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities.  The benefits can be enormous; each 1 percent increase in reuse of S&T, elimination of inefficient redundancy and increased community interaction, results in a more capable military and gives the DoD the opportunity to redirect >$100 Million.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to support and unleash the value of DoD\u2019s R&D portfolio."

IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition\/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research and Engineering (R&E) focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and information collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, unmanned aerial vehicle visual\/audible signature reduction, and improvements to the ballistic resistance of body armor.  \n\nThe IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies.  In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing scientific and technical information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges. Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting\/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense R&E community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence. This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&E community at large."
