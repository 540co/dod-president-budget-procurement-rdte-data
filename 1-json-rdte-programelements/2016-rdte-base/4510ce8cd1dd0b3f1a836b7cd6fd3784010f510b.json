The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and\/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  Manufacturing Technologies is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates manufacturing technologies for existing upgrades and\/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs."
