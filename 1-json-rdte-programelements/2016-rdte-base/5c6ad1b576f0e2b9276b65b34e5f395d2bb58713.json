            "val": "This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and military information support operations (MISO) systems.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  \n\nWarrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. \n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed (C2) communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats. \n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system improvements and testing to meet continually changing technology on the battlefield. \n\nBody Armor and Associated Equipment:\nThis project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exists on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular\/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.  \n\nMunitions Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign\/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.\n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production\/distribution\/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders."

The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n  \u2022 SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.\n\n\u2022  The Special Communications Enterprise (SCE) program includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring.

Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions and personnel safety equipment such as harnesses and safety retention devices.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nSOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  \n\nTactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\nCounter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future radio controlled improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks."

Sensor technology being developed includes image intensification (I2) thermal imaging, short wave infrared (SWIR), multi-spectral, fusion, and other sensor types.  Developments will decrease weight, increase range, increase situational awareness, provide data, image processing, image filtering, determine wind speed, observe bullet trace, and sensor fusion to be able to detect, identify, classify and engage targets at greater ranges.  These projects ensure SOF systems shall remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. \n\n\u2022 Prior to FY 2015, the MISO Broadcast Systems (MISOB) consisted of the Media Production Center (MPC) Family of Systems (FoS); Product Distribution System (PDS); Fly Away Broadcast System (FABS); and the Long Range Broadcast System (LRBS). Starting in FY 2015 the MISO Broadcast System will be split into these individual programs of records.  These systems provide fixed or deployable technologies that fulfill the requirements of the MISO seven phase processes in support to theater commanders. This project is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or inter-operate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements and includes:\n\n\u2022 Media Production and Broadcast Systems support the MPC and FABS MISO missions.  The MPC includes the fixed site MPC with light and medium media production capability.  FABS is a transit case fly-away broadcast system that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems. \n\n\u2022 LRBS is a family of broadcast systems intended to be integrated to multiple unmanned, long-loiter aerial systems with the capability of broadcasting in AM, FM, SW,TV, Very High Frequency (VHF), TV Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and cellular (Short Message Service, Multi-Media Messaging Service, and Voice).  This system provides the capability of broadcasting MISO messages via multiple mediums into denied foreign areas.\n\n\u2022 PDS provides the satellite communications (SATCOM) transport path for the worldwide Military Information Support Operations (MISO) architecture. PDS consists of three variants that are used at different levels of command from the Media Operations Complex (MOC) to the Tactical MISO Teams in order to link MISO planners with review\/approval authorities, production facilities, and dissemination elements."

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  This project enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle along with other improvements, Visual Augmentation Systems, and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."
