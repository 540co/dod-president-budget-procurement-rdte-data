            "val": "Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) would be adversely effected in operations in Anti-Access\/Area-Denial (A2\/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare whose effects may be enhanced by other techniques.  Therefore, in FY 2016 the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) will return with a new focus that seeks to enable the development and deployment of Joint robust\/resilient and assured communications.  The goal is to mitigate degradation across the operational tiers (strategic, operational, and tactical) and domains (nuclear, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR], command and control [C2], etc.) to ultimately support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders (JFCCs), Joint Force Commanders (JFCs), and deployed forces. \n\nThe DoD has large investments in TDLs that may have to operate in an A2\/AD environment.  Examples include communications planning systems (across multiple domains and echelons), situational awareness capabilities with limited automation support for highly dynamic A2\/AD environments, aerial networking technologies that create Beyond-Line-of-Sight(BLOS)communications, and networking backbone technologies for disruptive environments.  This research will develop new technology and exploit existing methodologies to ensure performance in A2\/AD environments.  Additionally, this will enable standardization of military network communications capabilities across the Department.\n\nBeginning in FY 2016, the Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM) project will specifically address the need for improvements in robustness and efficiency to the current Link-16, which is the primary data link deployed over 10,000 radios with United States (U.S.) and Allied militaries.  It will focus mainly on developing ways to improve the resiliency and range\/reachability of the tactical data links lost due to conditions in an A2\/AD environment.  This will include advanced and improved Link 16 waveform designs, receiver processing algorithms, and advanced data forwarding and routing overlay technologies as well as alternative antenna systems."
