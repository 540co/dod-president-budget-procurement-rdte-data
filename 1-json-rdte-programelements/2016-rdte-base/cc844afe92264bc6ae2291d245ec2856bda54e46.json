The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:\n\nEnterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.\nEnterprise Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.\nEnterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. \n\nThe AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield."
