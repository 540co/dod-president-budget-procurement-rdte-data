            "val": "Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, and protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.\n\nThis program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as identified in the 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science and Technology (S&T) Roadmap, the 2013 Cyber S&T Capability Gap Framework and other assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Progress and results are reviewed by the DoD Cyber S&T Community of Interest.  New efforts will also be aligned with emerging U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) mission requirements."

While the focus in cyber research is often placed on individual technologies, how these technologies work toward an effective mission is critical for the DoD.  The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course of action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.

This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked."
