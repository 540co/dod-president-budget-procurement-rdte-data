This project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, supplies and equipment.  \n\nOTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives.  The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE).  Funding is also used to support the planning, execution and reporting of Intelligence and Electronic Warfare operational testing.\n\nThis project also provides funding for the Army Joint Test Element (JTE) which examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and DoD agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  DoDD 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The DA G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DoD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two Joint Test Units (JTU) under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the OSD Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM."
