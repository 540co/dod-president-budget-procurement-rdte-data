            "val": "The Army has approved engineering change proposals for the Abrams, Bradley and Stryker programs to restore lost platform capability and host inbound technologies.  \n\nThis Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified in Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement Program will address Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command, and Control (C3) issues with the Stryker family of vehicles.  Primary focus is on the Stryker ECP 1 effort which will enable the Stryker Double-V Hull (DVH) fleet to buy back the Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) that has been lost as a result of vehicle changes required to counter the evolving threats that were present in the Theater of Operations.  The ECP 1 effort will allow the DVH fleet to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure that the DVH fleet can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY16-20 supports continued development engineering, prototype build and testing efforts for Stryker ECP 1."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command \u2013 Platfom (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP 2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY 2017.   The Bradley M2A4 Vehicle is the combination of the Base Vehicle, ECP 1 and ECP 2.  A separate integration effort began in FY 2014 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, Improved Forward Looking Infrared (IFLIR) integration effort will begin in FY 2016 that will replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability."

ECP 1 production contract awarded in FY 2014, scheduled to begin fielding in FY 2015.  ECP 2 is scheduled to field in FY 2019 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. This ECP development will be executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Initiate studies and analysis in order to integrate Improved Forward Looking Infrared (IFLIR) sights. The IFLIR (ECP 2B) system will be developed by Project Manager, Terrestrial Sensors (PM TS) and be provided to Product Manager Bradley as a Horizontal Technology Insertion effort.  Initiate development contract for Underbelly armor kit development in FY 2016."

The ECP 1 effort will allow the DVH fleet to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with a digital backbone, this will ensure that the DVH fleet can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.

In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP efforts on the DVH and defer efforts on flat bottom Strykers.  ECP 1 Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Production decision (Phase III) will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A Project EE2 funds the Stryker ECP 1 program, which was previously funded by PE Number 0603653A\/Project C03 (FY13) and Project C51 (through FY14)."
