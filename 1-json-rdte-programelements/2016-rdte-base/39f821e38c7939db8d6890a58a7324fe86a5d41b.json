Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs\/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons\/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison\/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.  \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nResearch is transitioned to PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology) and PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism, Technology Development).  \n\nWork in this PE is led, managed or performed by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Deployable force protection activities are coordinated with research, development and engineering centers and laboratories across the US Army, Navy and Air Force."

This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports Deployable force protection (DFP) efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated in with local communities.      \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Maneuver, and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS. Deployable force protection activities are coordinated with research, development and engineering centers and laboratories across the US Army, Navy and Air Force."

The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.
