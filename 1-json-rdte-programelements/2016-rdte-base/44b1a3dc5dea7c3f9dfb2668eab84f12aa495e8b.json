Emphasis is on providing component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives.\nUSCYBERCOM in conjunction with the Services and National Agencies will develop and expand Infrastructure modules to support Cyber Mission Forces.  \n\nDefend the Nation - CYBERCOM in conjunction with the Services and Agencies will develop the tools and capabilities, as well as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to be prepared to Defend the Nation. Developing a diverse cyber portfolio is essential for USCYBERCOM to conduct operations to include reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA); block; and counter TTPs against imminent or hostile cyber activity in support of the Defend the Nation mission from adversary cyberspace operations.\n\nCombatant Command Support - CYBERCOM in conjunction with the Services and Agencies will develop the tools and capabilities necessary to support Geographic or Functional Combatant Command (CCMD) contingency and crisis action plans.  Focus is on developing target accesses and capabilities necessary to achieve CCMD objectives during OPLAN execution and expediting technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Increase the cyberspace capability portfolio by investing in the tools and capabilities that will be able to cause the desired effects using cyber at the exact time and place required by the Combatant Commander (CCDR). This essential development work is focused exclusively on CCMD priorities and will ensure achievement of CCMD military objectives. \n\nOperate and Defend the DODIN - CYBERCOM in conjunction with the Services and Agencies will develop essential tools, and TTPs to defend the DoD Information Networks and cyber key terrain.  CYBERCOM conducts global cyberspace operations to deter, disrupt, and defeat adversary cyberspace operations in order to defend U.S. Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR).  Enabling active defense of key terrain, operationally linked to aggressive counter-cyber threat actions, improvement of overall mission security posture, and reinforcement of organic network defenders during a cyber event. \n\nCYBER Situational Awareness - To develop a Common Operating Picture for cyber situational awareness for the Services and CCMDs.  Cyber Situational Awareness is critical to a Commander's ability to plan, execute, and assess the mission by providing an IT over-watch environment to decision makers.  This capability will enable Commanders to understand their network topology, identify cyber terrain, determine mission impact, increase Commander information flow while enabling decisions and action within operationally relevant timelines."
