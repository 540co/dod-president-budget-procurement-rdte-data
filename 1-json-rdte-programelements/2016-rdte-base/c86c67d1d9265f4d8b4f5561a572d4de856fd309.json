                            "val": "The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. \n\nThe CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products.  \n\nIn FY 2014, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Africa, the \n\nPhilippines, Mexico, and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles, personal and physical protection, user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides, and weapons, sights, and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico, the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems, the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS), and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. \n\nFor U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement and first responders, CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  \n\nFY15 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates, CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM\u2019s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Specifically, CTTS will address personnel and physical security for small forces deployed to austere and hostile environments. In parallel, CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  \n\nCTTS will continue to actively support the Department\u2019s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM, including Defense support of civil authorities, interagency coordination, Special Operations support, and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus, this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment."

Developed and delivered prototype software that enabled fusion of imagery and text-based data that relates changes in patterns of life to variables affecting quality of life. Began developing a prototype entity extraction\/guided clustering software that significantly improves the quality and accuracy of data analyses by enabling analysts to change relationships in the data in real-time as part of a \u201cguided clustering\u201d capability while automating the actual analysis. Initiate the development of an enhanced Critical Thinking Tool that will support the application of evidence-based reasoning to intelligence questions and capture analytic problem-solving approaches. Started integration & performed initial operational evaluation of an Interagency analytic & situational awareness platform enabling fusion of existing sensors, social media, & analytic systems into a single platform. Continued development and proof of concept for multi-model analyses using Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) to make better decisions and establish measures of effectiveness for multiple courses of action.
