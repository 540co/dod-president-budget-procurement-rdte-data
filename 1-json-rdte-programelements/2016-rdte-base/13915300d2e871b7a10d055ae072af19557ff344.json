            "val": "The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program funds development planning (DP) to include early systems engineering and pre-acquisition planning and analysis. These activities include requirements analysis, capability decomposition and trade space characterization, concept development (system of systems, air, space, and cyber), cost analysis, modeling and simulation of representative or prototype systems, and costs associated with these activities to include analytical tools and travel. Outcomes of these activities are fiscally and technologically informed requirements, mature concepts that are technically feasible, and areas for science and technology (S&T) investment to reduce technology risks. These activities provide the analytic basis for cost and capability trades to inform weapon systems requirements and acquisition milestones, decision points, and phases. A number of Department of Defense (DoD), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and independent studies point to a need for more disciplined, early-phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning and analysis to produce decision-quality acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program. Early-phase systems engineering and technical planning activities funded by this program provide the foundation for informed investment decisions leading to successful acquisition programs. Specific efforts are determined each year based upon the highest Air Force priorities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
