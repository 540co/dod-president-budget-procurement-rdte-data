It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review.  Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available.  This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration. \n\n(PROJ 812) project funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing.   Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment.   Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA Funds.\n\n(PROJ 832) this project funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  Mature commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also evaluated for military use.  Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel.  Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. \n\n(PROJ 849) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases.  These products fall between four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission.  FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use.    Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. \n\n(PROJ VS8) program receives products that transition from VS7 and funds effort to complete research and development for the MEDEVAC Mission Essential Packages (MEPs) to support 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters. The force design will increase the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operation needs.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

At this time no Army funds are projected for this project. Anticipate DHP RDT&E funds to be used in support of the joint requirement.  Replacement for the M-138 Steam Sterilizer:  In FY13 the sterilizer project had undergone a major shift in contract strategy. Funds will be used to allow a manufacturer to fully develop and achieve FDA approval by the end of FY15. At the end of the contract period, it is fully anticipated that the Army will have a new sterilizer available for fielding. Moved this project through the DOD Acquisition process to accommodate the modernization effort.  Medical Equipment Sets Development:  Continue development and testing to ensure the most current and cost effective devices are being utilized. Equipment is selected for modernization based on its own life cycle plan as part of a Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKO). Modernization also occurs when products are discontinued, new models are available and new technology introduced to meet the current standard of patient care.  TBI Diagnostic Assay System Increment II Point of Care Device:  The focus of this effort is to use the current Biomarker technology developed by Banyan and cross-level all known technologies to Abbott Diagnostics. Contracting efforts are in place to facilitate this path forward. Army currently uses the i-STAT in assemblages. The intent of this effort is to modernize the i-STAT platform to accommodate the new cartridges associated with the TBI Biomarkers.  Noninvasive Neurodiagnostics TBI:  Noninvasive Neurodiagnostic technologies for TBI is multi-focused program that transitions product from S&T and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products. Efforts to collate all non-invasive technologies into one integrated IPT are currently in place. The 3 technologies currently involved are the Eye- Tracking System, the QEEG and Balance Platforms.  Future components of the multi-focused approach fall under the scope of this line item. Anticipate full-up IPTs with funding allocations designated in FY15.  Impedance Threshold Device for the Treatment of TBI:  Current device has a 510(k) (Premarket Notification) clearance for multiple indications. The submission of a new 510(k) is planned to cover the expanded indications for the currently fielded device.  Advanced Wound Dressing:  Conducting comparative studies for the Advanced Wound Care COTS products (in-vivo animal or human studies)."

Milestone C start delayed in FY14.  The ESB will assist preventative medicine personnel certify water capabilities by providing a presumptive screening capability that can rapidly identify toxicity in water.  Waste Treatment System for the CSH:  Develop Waste Treatment System (WTS) for the CSH. The WTS will render liquid and other fluid medical (biohazard) waste products sterile and otherwise inert to the environment in austere, deployed locations. Current methods do mitigate the risk of contamination, but only reduce the levels of agents left behind; they cannot assure total inactivation of all pathogens or the neutralization of chemical agents.  Altitude Readiness Management System (ARMS):  Complete validation\/verification of the Altitude Readiness Management System (ARMS). The ARMS product is a handheld sensor and software decision device to plan, monitor, and manage unit altitude illness risk and task performance prediction. Transition from 836.  Improved Vector Trap:  Develop prototypes of the Improved Vector Trap for testing. The Improved Vector Trap is a device which allows for the attraction and subsequent collection of disease-carrying insects for disease risk assessment.  Transition from 836.  Portable Vector Identification Workstation:  Begin development of field deployable Vector Identification Workstation to provide situational awareness necessary to prevent\/mitigate vector borne threats and associated environmental hazards."

These products fall within four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and determining if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members' insect control\/preventive medicine measures to limit exposure and disease transmission.  It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials for large-scale human effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) testing, expanded human safety clinical trials, long-term animal studies, and related manufacturing tests.  This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed.  Medical products approved for human use must successfully complete a series of clinical trials that are required and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use.  Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment).  Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis , and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in Africa Command, Central Command, European Command, Southern Command, and Pacific Command areas are at the top of the infectious diseases requirements list."

In 2009, a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades and retrofits the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."
