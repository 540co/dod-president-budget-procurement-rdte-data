            "val": "Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) is a materiel solution meeting the requirements for a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant Government purpose rights software waveforms (applications). HMS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID Program that encompasses specific requirements to support the US Army, US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) communication needs.\n\nHMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge\/most disadvantaged Warfighter with an on the move, at the halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)\/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Factor (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.\n\nHMS is currently executing an April 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure modified non-developmental items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. Phase 1 is to procure an NDI AN\/PRC-154A Rifleman Radio (RR) for use in a classified environment. The RR ports the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform.  Phase 2 is procuring an NDI AN\/PRC-155 Manpack (MP) for use in a classified environment. Waveforms to be ported to HMS MP include: SRW, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)-Army managed waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM)-Army managed waveform, and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS)-Navy managed waveform. \n\nThe Army will award Multiple Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) IDIQ Contracts through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts and initial delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (4QFY15 for RR and 1QFY16 for MP).\nb. Award second delivery orders based on qualification test results (2QFY16 for RR and 3QFY16 for MP)\nc. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (2QFY17 for RR and 4QFY17 for MP).\n\nFollowing full and open competition, qualified NDI RR and MP Radios will require operationally-relevant testing to inform a Full Rate Production decision and to support fielding to Capability Set units.\n\nThe FY 2016 budget will provide funding that is necessary to execute the required full and open competition contract strategy for the RR and MP products. Specifically, the funding is needed to conduct Operational Testing for the RR candidate products to demonstrate compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; and to obtain material release for FRP. The funding will also support safety, spectrum supportability, and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding."

HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Factor (SFF) versions of HMS may be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record. The program has completed the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase and received Milestone C approval on 17 June 2011 with Low Rate Initial Production configured radios.\n\nHMS is currently executing an April 2014 approved acquisition strategy to procure modified non-developmental items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. Phase 1 is to procure an NDI AN\/PRC-154A Rifleman Radio (RR) for use in a classified environment. The RR ports the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)-Army managed waveform.  Phase 2 is procuring an NDI AN\/PRC-155 Manpack (MP) for use in a classified environment. Waveforms to be ported to HMS MP include: SRW, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)-Army managed waveform, Satellite Communications (SATCOM)-Army managed waveform, and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS)-Navy managed waveform. \n\nThe Army will award Multiple Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) IDIQ Contracts through a multiple step selection process:\na. Award FFP Contracts and initial delivery orders to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (4QFY15 for RR and 1QFY16 for MP).\nb. Award second delivery orders based on qualification test results (2QFY16 for RR and 3QFY16 for MP)\nc. Award FRP delivery orders based on operational assessments and best value trade off construct (2QFY17 for RR and 4QFY17 for MP).\n\nFollowing full and open competition, qualified NDI RR and MP Radios will require operationally-relevant testing to inform a Full Rate Production decision and to support fielding to Capability Set units.\n\nThe FY 2016 budget will provide funding that is necessary to execute the required full and open competition contract strategy for the RR and MP products. Specifically, the funding is needed to conduct Operational Testing for the RR candidate products to demonstrate compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; and to obtain material release for FRP. The funding will also support safety, spectrum supportability, and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding."
