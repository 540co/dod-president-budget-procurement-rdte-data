            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."
