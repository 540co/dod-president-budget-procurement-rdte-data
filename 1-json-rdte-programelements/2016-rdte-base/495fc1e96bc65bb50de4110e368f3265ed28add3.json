Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

                                                "val": "The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons.\n\n  In FY 2014, progress was made toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by an HSST FY 2011 test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were initiated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, variable Mach number 4.5-7.5 aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aeropropulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that component technologies have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the facility development including design enhancements and fabrication of the combustion cooler, installation, checkout and activation of the clean air regenerative storage heater, associated support systems, instrumentation and controls required for facility operation. The exhaust air ejector system was activated to provide longer facility run times. Design efforts for subsequent phases progressed including the critical design of the air delivery system. Another FY 2014 effort examined the incorporation of advanced morphing ceramic components for hypersonic ground test facilities into the design of common facility nozzle and ducting hardware to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Critical design of the morphing ceramic components direct-connect nozzle and distortion generator components and integrated system was completed. Fabrication of the direct-connect component fabrication was started and freejet nozzle design concepts were evaluated. This technology promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a \u201cfirst-ever\u201d realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing costs and increasing productivity.\n  Large scale scramjet engine test techniques accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Following the successful completion of the benchmark HSST freejet test series utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet in a larger facility, the semi-freejet test configuration testing was initiated in a smaller facility. Upon completion of the final direct connect phase of the project, the resulting analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities will allow the optimized utilization of existing facilities and define the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.  Another task, that researched improved high speed test techniques, examined the unique and extensive set of ground and flight test data collected by the X-51 program for use in the development of advanced techniques for high speed engine design, development and testing. This effort documented the test techniques used and analyzed how the test data was utilized in the engine development process so that lessons learned and important test technology gaps could be identified. The work resulted in completion of the first ever in-flight mass capture and thrust uncertainty assessment conforming to the U.S. National Uncertainty Standard. \n  An arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development made significant progress toward independently-powered spin-coil technologies to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, and its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces.  This effort will improve the service lives of the electrodes and improve hypersonic nozzle flow quality.  The conceptual design of the spin coil was completed, and spin coil power supply requirements were specified. Improved computational and numerical simulation models were completed involving magnetic field and arc column interactions with the air flow in the heater necessary to investigate advanced designs and allow for efficient parallel computing of the simulations.  The HSST project initiated research that will provide better determination of surface heating, viscous drag, and boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance.  Experimental results will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition (BLT) mechanisms. Design and fabrication of hypersonic vehicle models were completed for the BLT efforts.\n  An autonomous flight safety system test technology developed by HSST to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle under test was transitioned to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office. The first prototype successfully flew onboard the ORS-3\/Minotaur I rocket.  Compared to traditional man-in-the-loop systems, autonomous flight safety system provides wider flight corridors, over the horizon flight coverage, reduced infrastructure, remote launch site capability, and improved mission assurance; thereby maximizing safety while reducing flight test costs.  Another HSST flight test technology transitioned, demonstrating advanced parameter identification maneuvers during the fourth X-51 flight.  Post-test analysis confirmed that this proven optimization technique enables the acquisition of much more vehicle aero performance data in less time and fewer flights than traditional techniques, thus reducing the costs for future development systems.  Progress continued toward the development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric sensing system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed\/direction, O2 content) along a hypersonic vehicle\u2019s flight path.  Design, fabrication, and implementation of all components into a portable system were completed.  Calibration, system validation testing, and a full demonstration in support of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon flight test were accomplished. This technology will be a significant advancement over current technologies, improving the accuracy of determining atmospheric conditions at high altitudes needed for assessing the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.\n  Progress was made in advanced high speed system ground and flight test instrumentation.  A prototype real gas force measurement balance system with high stiffness and frequency response to make measurements in hypervelocity flows with test times of 1-2 milliseconds was developed. The balance system was calibrated and a rigorous uncertainty analysis was performed.  This will substantially increase the accuracy of high Mach force measurements that are required to evaluate and improve models of air chemistry in design and prediction codes. Development of an advanced system to measure gas properties in high speed flows was completed utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum along with advanced transmit and receive optical fiber systems.  Two of the non-intrusive flow measurements developments for hypersonic test facilities systems, which significantly lower gas property measurement uncertainty, were fabricated and transitioned to DoD facilities.  The calibration and measurement uncertainty analysis of the HSST-developed non-intrusive laser hygrometer system was completed.  A high temperature shear stress sensor was successfully tested in a DoD hypervelocity wind tunnel and on a scramjet engine forebody inlet ramp.  A mid-infrared thermal imaging technique effort was initiated.  This technique will permit quantitative thermal imaging of hypersonic model surface flow for high enthalpies without capturing flow field emissivity effects that can shroud surface temperature imaging.  \n  Advances were achieved in the development of state-of-the-art modeling and simulation tools.  Beta testing by a broad spectrum of the hypersonic community continues for an advanced three-dimensional stability and transition analysis for hypersonic boundary layer code and hypersonic nozzle characteristics based grid generation code.  The code was used to support the design of a DoD hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed. The code was also used for development of the HSST variable Mach number nozzle and distortion generator. The advanced code was used during a hypervelocity test at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) to analyze and predict the characteristics and extent of boundary layer transition on the test article surface resulting from variations in nose bluntness, unit Reynolds number, and angle of attack. An improved Computed Tomography Method (CTM) algorithm capable of constructing more complex flow field patterns for optical absorption measurements was developed.  The algorithm creates two-dimensional spatial maps of exhaust gas properties from multi-line-of-sight tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy measurements for verifying code predictions and for determining combustion efficiency for turbine and scramjet engines.  This development takes advantage of increased processing speed, higher accuracy and increased computational efficiency to greatly increase the diagnostic value of measurements from miniature, robust tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy gas diagnostic sensor systems, which are now used for engine ground and flight testing. A project was initiated to develop a transient thermal analysis software toolset to support T&E of hypersonic vehicle Thermal Protection System (TPS) aerothermal and ablation response to high speed, high temperature flow in ground and flight test environments. A real-gas model capability was incorporated into the software flow field solver.  The vitiation effects computational fluid dynamics study was completed. The study determined the ability of the Wind-US 3.0 computational fluid dynamics code to aid in the developmental test and evaluation of complex high speed\/hypersonic propulsion systems and facilities utilizing existing HSST scramjet engine test data sets."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band, opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

Technology to improve the efficiency of a telemetry network utilizing the advanced Shaped Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (SOQPSK) modulation scheme continued.  Development of a multi-band transceiver operating in the L\/S\/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms continued.  SET continued an effort to autonomously analyze collected telemetry data and based on priority, select which data to transmit over the telemetry network.  Additionally, SET matured several efforts to improve the performance of telemetry data links.  SET continued efforts to improve the performance of a serial streaming telemetry link in a multipath environment by developing a sync marker for the telemetry data.

Development of a telemetry transceiver capable of dynamically reconfiguring the data modulation scheme based on telemetry link conditions continued.  \n  Development of a non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne platforms was completed, demonstrated, and transitioned to support the deployment of a networked telemetry system. This technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter.\n  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in a range of terrestrial and atmospheric environments. A technical investigation into the telemetry link performance of the C-Band versus S-Band spectrum for a missile test mission was completed and the performance results transitioned to the test ranges.

SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology to enable flexible scheduling of the T&E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L\/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.\n  The SET project completed the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.  This tool provides higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain, environments, and various other factors on telemetry channels.  This tool was transitioned to the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center to support pretest analysis of mission flight profiles.  \n  The SET project initiated an effort to develop digital beam forming and steering technologies for an airborne phased array antenna.

Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. \n  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and countering weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  \n  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that employs a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency (RF) ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  Development has been completed and a user demonstration conducted at an urban training site, achieving sub-meter accuracy (~0.6 meter), both indoor and outdoor. \n  An inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters continued in development; the system employs boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours.  A re-design of the distance measuring radios was completed; algorithms were implemented; and the ability to geolocate a dismounted warfighter conducting activities over two hours of free movement in the absence of GPS was demonstrated.  \n  Efforts continued to develop technology to measure projectile position and attitude (six degrees of freedom) of high-velocity, spinning projectiles (at accuracies that significantly exceed the system under test guidance system).  This technology will provide continuous estimation of the state description of a projectile (three components of position and orientation) through the duration of projectile flight via accurate and rapid RF range observations between the projectile and ground-based components.  Successful shock and spin testing have been completed; synchronization and scheduling are being optimized.  The AIST project continued to develop a system to measure warfighter indoor location (GPS-denied environment) at sub-meter accuracies using ambient amplitude modulation (AM) radio broadcast signals.  AM signal propagation during day and night was evaluated at an urban training range; data was collected at a variety of urban range structures noting centimeter accuracy within a prison structure.  Efforts continued to develop technology that provides a seamless transition between outdoor and indoor environments to accurately track systems under test using modified GPS receivers, relayed GPS signals, and multilateration; this included work on reducing multipath effects.  Results to date indicate that other filters and other sensors e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated into the system can potentially provide an overall TSPI solution with sub-meter accuracies. \n  In support of other instrumentation solutions, an electro-releasable attachment technology development effort continued.  This included investigation of new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch to allow attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles.  Such technology would significantly reduce the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  Development of the foil patch focused on improving operating temperature range and adhesion strength in preparation for environmental testing (e.g., resistance to lightning strike) and end-to-end field testing at air and ground test activities.  \n  The AIST project continued development of a fiber-optic instrumentation suite to integrate into test projectiles for measurement of magnetic field strength in the harsh environment of the Navy electromagnetic railgun (EMRG). Full-up testing with three EMRG shots at the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division was conducted, achieving a significant benchmark by successfully measuring, for the first time, magnetic field strengths in an EMRG-launched projectile at 15-20 kG forces.  Additional tests are planned at higher energy levels. \n  The AIST project developed algorithms and methods for automated detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) to allow the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations. Testing has been successfully conducted at undersea ranges and a baseline classifier for 6 marine mammal species is currently running real-time, range-wide at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Pacific Range Missile Facility, and the Southern California Offshore Range.  This test technology supports the Navy\u2019s Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) ensuring adherence to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Additional classifiers have been developed or improved and will be integrated into marine mammal monitoring nodes and transitioned to the Navy\u2019s major undersea ranges.\n  To support the needs of test ranges that conduct arena testing for weapon systems, AIST continued developing technology that uses passive imaging to characterize munition warhead fragment size, velocity, and distribution.  This technology will significantly reduce set-up times and data analysis costs of current warhead arena test techniques.  \n  The AIST project continued to develop technology that accurately provides dynamic measurements of warfighter body posture, and head and weapon orientation using fiber optic shape sensing integrated into a body suit to be worn under the uniform Shape accuracies for component and system measurements were over 99 percent accurate in laboratory testing; angle accuracies were well within 1 degree of the truth.  A single channel breadboard system was demonstrated, displaying real-time dynamic shape data on a human test subject, producing similar accuracy results observed in laboratory settings.  \n  Development of technology to assess warfighter cognitive states continued.  Accomplishments included developing an integrated dry electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near infrared (fNIR) sensor system capable of simultaneous measurement of brain electrical activity and blood oxygen level; an unobtrusive headset for test subjects; mental workload assessment software; and verification of system functionality.\n  An effort continued to investigate means to mitigate the impacts of wind energy system interference on test range radars.  AIST evaluated four mitigation approaches to minimize the effects of wind turbines with the goal of reducing their effects by 60-70dB; a combination of the top three mitigation approaches is estimated to provide approximately 63dB performance improvement of T&E range radars in the presence of wind turbine interference.  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and government laboratories.  These efforts will provide significant advances to T&E of modern war fighting systems."

                            "val": "The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.\n  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

Similar work on HEL energy sensors for small targets such as mortars and rockets continued under two parallel efforts, with preliminary design completed.

The test technology will allow improved imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, development of a light detection and ranging system (LIDAR) to measure atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path continued.  The laboratory demonstration and testing of the sub-systems completed. This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.  Measuring these profiles will enable understanding of how atmospheric effects distort HEL beam propagation.  A maritime version of this technology continued with completion of a preliminary design review.\n  Testing of electric and magnetic field sensors continued in support of electromagnetic railgun (EMRG) T&E with development of new techniques to reduce noise on these measurements; these techniques increased the quality of data obtained to benchmark railgun development codes.  DET developed a prototype miniature differential current measurement system that measures the current at nodes in a target circuit, allowing analysis of HPM effects at sub-component level. DET also developed a proof-of-concept voltage probe with bandwidths up to 100 MHz, allowing non-intrusive voltage measurements in HPM engagements.  These probes are also useful for C-IED applications. \n  The DET project completed design of an advanced radome that will allow more reliable operation of the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) HPM Wide Band Threat Source over all 5 bands of operation, enabling more robust, cost effective testing of U.S. systems against HPM threats. Development of a compact hard tube vircator (CHTV) to cover two frequency bands of interest continued.  The CHTV development will result in an HPM source for testing in-chamber HPM effects, which at certain frequencies, is a gap in current MIL-STD-464C testing.\n  The DET project initiated a study of options for technology replacement of the WSMR fast burst reactor for sources that simulate nuclear weapon prompt radiation output (neutron radiation) for survivability testing of U.S. systems.

Additionally, the NST project develops technologies to analyze and evaluate the increasingly massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by complex net-centric tests.  The technology to conduct T&E on net-centric systems is challenged by sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide an accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness) as the data passes among different systems of Service and coalition participants.  \n  The NST technologies advance test automation (test planning, test execution, test control, and analysis) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using models and simulations along with hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information to the Global Information Grid. Furthermore, many of the warfighting capabilities being developed to support net-centric military operations are software-intensive and test technologies must be developed to fully characterize these systems. \n  Also included are technologies to support the testing and agile environment associated with Engineering Resilience Systems, a high-priority S&T area for the Department. The technology development efforts within the NST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priority investments, particularly in measuring \u201cData to Decision\u201d techniques in warfighting capabilities.

Efforts continued to develop technology to virtualize test sites into ultra-high-fidelity, real-time simulators. The goal is to facilitate verification, assessment, and evaluation of UASs in a realistic, risk free, highly measureable, statistically significant manner prior to field test.  The UAST project built automated tools to test the robustness of black-box UASs in unexpected operating scenarios. The technology feeds inputs that trigger software bugs to find vulnerabilities without costly field testing.  The test technology was developed and implemented as a prototype to enable black box system automated autonomy architecture stress testing, with a focus on UAS software and the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach is agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided testers with a perspective of system performance and a previously unavailable prediction of behavior. This automated stress testing tool was initially transitioned and integrated into the development and T&E processes for the Autonomous Mobility Appliqu\u00e9 System (AMAS), a multiplatform kit that integrates low-cost sensors and control systems onto U.S. Army and Marine Corps tactical vehicles to assist drivers or enable autonomous operation in convoys. Additionally, the UAS stress test tool was used on the Autonomous Aerial Cargo\/Utility System (AACUS), an Naval prototype that explores advanced autonomous capabilities for reliable resupply\/retrograde and, in the long term, casualty evacuation. In both cases, the UAST project stress testing technology identified failure modes before they were triggered in the field. Development continued on technology for test infrastructure that combines synthetic and actual forces to produce a realistic, real-time, interactive autonomous vehicle test environment. This technology is also being developed to provide safe testing assurances via on-board safety monitoring.\nFY 2015 Plans: \nWork on virtualizing test sites will complete and transition to T&E agencies as will the stress testing tool.

The UAST project will further explore test technologies to meet the challenges of testing autonomy by leveraging advances made in the standardization of UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. UAST will initiate research in the area of autonomous system test planning to develop technologies which develop the most salient test plans for maritime, air, and ground-based autonomous systems and enable test ranges to identify the degree of regression testing required for autonomous systems upon changes to the hardware and software."
