The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between IPPS-A, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\n - GoArmy Ed is an Army continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway to request Tuition Assistance (TA) online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses.  GoArmy Ed is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers.  GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  GoArmyED is used by authorized users to pursue their post secondary educational goals: Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.\n\nModernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and is actively integrating the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over 9 million combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory.  The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicide attempts are collected and stored in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Funding supports research and development to comply with Dept of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.0 million. \n\nFunding for CWID will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development. Funding for ABHIDE will continue development of the system."

The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed service members' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System supports other soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army CIO Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management\/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.\n\nFY 2016 Base funding in the amount of $4.611 million will be used for the engineering effort required to provide the Defense Health Clinical Systems (DHCS) TMIP-J software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capability.  Activities include:\n--Integration testing of DHCS\/TMIP releases, other software systems on the MC4 baseline \n--All other testing to include operational, security, acceptance of TMIP and other software products\n--Research of technologies to integrate software into Army future information infrastructure, such as exploration of virtualization for MC4; and Remote Desktop Services applications\n--Evaluation of hardware technology obsolescence and solutions\n--Interfaces with other systems, e.g. Nett Warrior"

The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) integrated software application suite and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since TMIP software is a major component of the MC4 System being developed in increments, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program continues to work with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, etc) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

Whenever possible, PM AcqBusiness provides access to external enterprise tools and services from other business domains, Army, OSD and DISA and does not duplicate those capabilities. PM AcqBusiness provides Army Acquisition practitioners with a consistent set of unique business tools, web services, and decision support tools integrated through a common architecture, which provide visibility of authoritative data, consistency in business process, and more timely support to acquisition decisions. The enterprise tools provided via PM AcqBusiness enable the reduction and eventual elimination of stovepipe and redundant tools that exist in the domain today. PM AcqBusiness provides an environment that enables centralized, role-based access to trusted and authoritative data from disparate Acquisition Domain data sources. In addition, PM AcqBusiness provides a framework for information providers to publish their data and provide their services to authorized users.\n\nThe program also resources development requirements for the U.S. Army Accessioning Integrated Automation Architecture which provides the Information Technology solution necessary to accomplish the Army's Accessioning mission."

PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy, incorporating the use of COTS hardware and software, along with custom-developed software, in order to realize benefits early and reduce risk.  The AcqBusiness acquisition approach embraces the tenets of Subtitle III of Title 40, U.S.C. (formerly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).\n\nPM AcqBusiness leverages existing DoD and Army enterprise capabilities to fulfill Acquisition Domain business needs whenever possible.  When no Army enterprise systems satisfy approved requirements, priority is given to existing acquisition business systems or services where they are scalable and in conformance with technical architecture standards.  In the event neither of these options is available to satisfy a business need, capabilities are acquired as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. PM AcqBusiness maximizes use of COTS technology by implementing an architecture and infrastructure based on services and virtualization.  If there are no available COTS solutions, PM AcqBusiness will develop the capability, leveraging an incremental approach to enable: (1) consistent and phased definition of requirements, (2) mature technologies, and (3) collaboration among user, tester and developer.  \n\nAs such, PM AcqBusiness is:\n\n- collaborating with the ASA(ALT) community to facilitate Business Process Reengineering in advance of development of AcqBusiness capabilities.  \n\n- encouraging the purchase of commercial products and innovations from private industry.\n\n- involving potential suppliers early in the requirements generation process. \n\n- employing outsourcing wherever possible, and\n\n- acquiring AcqBusiness capabilities in interoperable modules, minimizing the time required to deliver new capabilities to users."

It followed the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS replaced, in full or in part, financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance Systems and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administer the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions. GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions on a virtually real time system.\n\nOn 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed to Wave 1 end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, Indiana and several other organizations. On 1 April 2009, GFEBS deployed to Wave 2 users at Fort Benning, Fort Stewart, DFAS Rome and several other organizations. Wave 3 deployed in October FY10, Wave 4 in January of FY11, Wave 5 in April 2011, Wave 6 in July 2011, Wave 7 in October 2011, Wave 8A in April 2012 and the final Wave 8B in July 2012. GFEBS is fielded to 53,000 trained end users. Each fielded release subsumes the previous release keeping all deployed sites executing under the same GFEBS release. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011 and Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Information Technology Development Project M05 provided GFEBS the ability to develop and build reports to meet auditability mandates and to accomplish efforts which enhance the GFEBS system with new reports and interfaces requiring technology development.

                            "val": "US Military Entrance Processing Command Integrated Resource System (MIRS) provides automation and communications capability to meet peacetime, mobilization and wartime military manpower accession mission for the Armed Services.  MIRS interfaces with recruiting capabilities for the services, incorporating the concept of electronic data sharing using standard DoD data elements between USMEPCOM and all Armed Services recruiting commands.  This project includes Computerized Adaptive Testing-Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (CAT-ASVAB), automated Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is given to determine applicants' mental abilities. Data Services mission consists of automatic data processing in support of USMEPCOM, the Selective Service System (SSS) and other external agencies for both peacetime and mobilization requirements. MIRS directly supports mobilization in the event of a military draft, through electronic links with the SSS and its ability to process and ship. USMEPCOM\/MIRS is the only DoD organization legally authorized to collect civilian, medical and testing data for purposes of processing into military services and is the only DoD joint support system used to enforce congressional, DoD and Armed Forces qualification criteria for enlistment.  USMEPCOM has established interfaces with US Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship status for applicants of military service to screen out undesired or security threat and Federal Bureau of Investigation for background screening using digital fingerprints to eliminate people with criminal records from entering military service. USMEPCOM's IT sustainment effort will maintain MIRS and the associated network certification and accreditation until the end of system lifecycle.  MIRS was scheduled to be replaced by the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).   VIPS program cancellation has placed USMEPCOMs legacy IT infrastructure at high risk. The resultant system leaves a non-compliant and non-networthy accession system with processing gaps that need to be addressed for secure, compliant, sustainable, and reliable capabilities to meet DoD and Service requirements.  USMEPCOM must continue toward security and data integrity regulatory\/security compliance (PII and HIPAA) or lose Authority to Operate.\nCustomers\/beneficiaries of this investment include the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM and OSD (P&R). \nStakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Asst Sec of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Mgmt Office, USD P&R, USD Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center and Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRequested funding mitigates inefficient system sustainability and scalability through an update of the applications underlying database, operating system and middleware software.  The current legacy system requires time consuming and expensive efforts to make operational changes (even minor ones) to military accessions processing to meet DoD and individual Services requirements. MIRS operational processes exist in a system where business rules and workflow are hard coded throughout the system.  Any changes require extensive review and analysis of the code to see what is impacted before a change can be made, then extensive testing afterwards to make sure it works correctly throughout the accession process.  Currently there are over 600 Problem Reports (PR) and System Change Requests (SCRs) pending. \nRequested funding also provides for a follow-on acquisition plan that will be informed by the recent DCMO initiated Technical Demonstration. The acquisition will provide future enhancements and additional capabilities like those to be proven through the currently evolving Tech Demo.  These efforts will culminate in new USMEPCOM business process vision of an anytime, anywhere accession processing capability."

The Army's goal is to streamline Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) end-to-end business processes; reduce operating, maintenance and support costs; minimize the number interfaces; support financial auditability; and promote and improve efficiencies when integrating with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERPs) solutions. This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 Oct 2014. Funds are to perform all requisite activities to concurrently develop pre-Milestone A documentation and perform pre-solicitation\/source selection activities expected of an ACAT III program. \n\nCommander's Risk Reduction Dashboard (CRRD) will consolidate information from multiple Army databases and present to commanders a concise report about which Soldiers in their unit have been involved with at-risk behaviors, some of which may be associated with suicide, and when those instances occurred. The dashboard will be able to generate multiple reports, including one that highlights just Soldiers with risk factors within a certain time period; another that focuses only on newly assigned Soldiers; and another that allows commanders to look at a specific Soldier's history with at-risk behaviors\n\nThe Army Safety and Health Management System (ASHMS) initiative provides a framework of people, processes and technology to synchronize, integrate and optimize Army Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) capabilities to preserve war fighting capabilities and enhance the force by providing a safe and healthy environment for Soldiers, Families, Civilians, and contractors. An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System \u2013 Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities.\n\nDesign, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of an enterprise Army Training Information System (ATIS) that provides a common operational picture (COP) of the training environment through integrated, interoperable training development, management, scheduling, and delivery capabilities.  Existing training information systems do not provide Commanders, leaders, Soldiers, and civilians a centralized COP of the training environment that enables persistent, consistent access to the Training and Education information and products necessary to support readiness to meet emerging threats.  Without ATIS, Army organizations will continue to develop and maintain a multitude of TIS that are not part of an enterprise, thus inhibiting visualization, understanding, and informed decision making.  \n\nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.  \n\nArmy Career Tracker (ACT) is a leader development tool created to change significantly the way training, education, and experiential learning support is provided to Army enlisted, officers, civilians, and their leaders\/supervisors.  Users can search multiple education and training resources, monitor career development, and receive advice from their leadership.  ACT provides single-site, easy access, and offers a complete and personalized career picture not available until now.  ACT allows users tmanage career objectives and monitor progress towards career requirements and goals.  ACT provides an integrated approach to supporting military and civilian personnel's personal and professional development which capitalizes on the mutual (personnel and Army) need for life-long learning.  The unique inter- relationship between the  user's personal growth and development, and the Army's need for Soldiers to be continuously developing, building and cultivating a culture of life-long learning is critical for the Soldier's and the Army's success.  ACT comprises over 780,000 users with an adoption rate of 4,000 users per week.   HQDA EXORD 054-12 ISO Army Transition mandates that leaders utilize roles in ACT to promote life-long learning and development opportunities throughout the Soldier's lifecycle of service (hire to retire).\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has RDTE for core automation support and to upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A, to inlcude the Civilian Personnel Online - Portal (CPOL-Portal), Fully Automated System for Classification (FASCLASS) and Overseas Entitlement Tracker (OET)."

An analysis of Army SOH Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Policies (DOTMLPF-P) determined that the Army Safety Management Information System \u2013 Revised (ASMIS-R), a Defense Business System, is currently not able to satisfy current and emerging ASHMS capability requirements without modernization to resolve these capability gaps. Changes in requirements for the Army Safety and Health Management System (Programmatic) related to DoDI 6055.01, AR 385-10, Information Assurance requirements and direct feedback from the Safety professionals within the DoD and the Army have resulted in the need for changes in associated business processes. Additionally, a business gap analysis performed by the DASA(ESOH) revealed a deficiency in the system's requirements that would support Army Commands in identifying hazards in the work place, determining hazard mitigation strategies and controls, employing these strategies and controls, and measuring their potential for reducing mishaps. Addressing these problems will have an immediate and direct impact on meeting regulatory requirements, improving data integrity, improving information assurance posture (compliance), increasing the Army's ability to reduce mishaps across the force structure, and promoting Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) capabilities. ."

As stated above, these are primarily related to meeting minimum DoD regulatory requirements related to the collection of mishap information, safety information storage, and resolving inefficiencies in data quality control and information flow.\n\nAdditionally, advances in technology allow for improvements in performance and data integrity that currently are deficiencies in the system. ASMIS-R, in its current state, does not provide any IT (material solution) to the business requirements identified above. The Command has utilized a FFP contract to execute specific Task Orders to develop the tools and products through mid-year FY15. The CRC will be competing a new contract vehicle to support the development of products and tools from midyear FY15 through FY19.\n\nHQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) Systems' Acquisition Strategy \u2013 The HQDA AG-1 Civilian Personnel (CP) office, Civilian Information Services Division (CISD) Chief and Program Managers will manage these modernization efforts and will utilize the HQDA AG-1 CP's Configuration Control Committee (CCC), Configuration Control Board (CCB), and Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to ensure the appropriate functionality is implemented into OET, CPOL Portal, and FASCLASS.  Development tasks will be performed by AG-1 CP's contractor staff, whose performance is monitored according to the Quality Assurance Surveillance Program. In addition, unit testing and operational testing will be implemented to ensure the new functionality performs as required.  This work will be performed on a firm- fixed- price contract vehicle."
