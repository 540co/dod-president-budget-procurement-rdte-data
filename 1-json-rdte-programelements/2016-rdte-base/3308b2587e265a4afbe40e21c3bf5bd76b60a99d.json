The HD R&D Program works closely with the Geographical Combatant Commands (GCC) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to identify, develop and implement mine\/UXO detection and clearance technologies; speed improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reduce the threat to host nation population and US forces; reduce insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhance mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and provide engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries. \n\nEvaluations of HD R&D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military, non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for US military countermine R&D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to world-wide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 172 evaluations in 37 countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program\u2019s technologies have cleared 26 million sq meters of the world\u2019s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 133,000 mines and UXO; and provided 350,000 mine\/UXO disposal charges with 40 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.\n\nNew technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO\/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCCs and mine-affected nations.  The program element\u2019s work is consistent with the Department of Defense\u2019s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with \u00a7 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines, unexploded ordnance and small arms ammunition."
