            "val": "The QRSP Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts demonstrations designed to address immediate COCOM needs.  QRSP efforts support the Department\u2019s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by supporting the development of potentially game-changing capabilities and by fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  QRSP enables the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) to respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames, inform the requirements process, and inject innovative technologies into programs of record.  The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  Focus areas align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access\/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; and autonomous systems.\n\nThe QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities, and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF initiates projects during the execution year and focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes for demonstration and evaluation.  The QRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).\n \nThe RRF program objectives, executed by the RRTO, are to develop prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies and accelerate the delivery of effective and affordable capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative concepts and technologies that supply critical capabilities to meet time-sensitive operational needs.  RRTO leverages technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, as well as small businesses and non-traditional sources, to address DoD needs as identified by COCOM, Military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  Typical RRF programs are six to 18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).       \n\nThe JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that have been submitted by COCOMs and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC\u2019s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the COCOM in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe SMA cell\u2019s objective is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational\/technical challenges, which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to Joint Staff\/COCOM-generated challenging problems and informs senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff\/COCOM\u2019s senior leadership."

QRF initiatives are limited to those that will deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.\n\nThe QRF Program focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, catastrophic, and irregular threats.  More specifically, initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas:  counter anti-access and area denial capabilities; base protection; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; newly emerging national threats; directed energy capabilities; low-cost precision engagement capabilities; operational field demonstrations; unmanned and robotics systems; counter weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and counter-electronic warfare technologies.  \n\nIn FY 2015 and FY 2016, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new projects and prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition to operational forces."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and addresses needs that arise outside the two-year budget cycle.  \n\nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO was established to accelerate the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&T) projects into operationally useful prototypes in the execution years.  The RRTO:  leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T base and those of the other federal departments, academia, and industry; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of prototypical capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Department\/Combatant Command (COCOM) priorities with a global perspective, RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities.  Prototypes delivered by RRTO provide cost effective capabilities to operational users faster than the typical acquisition cycle.\n\nIn prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that facilitates better interactions with small companies developing emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.   \n\nIn FY 2016, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations in support of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Emerging Capability & Prototyping) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2016 projects include:  capabilities to operate in denied areas; navigation in Global Positioning System-denied environments; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architectures; ISR sensors; global warming\u2019s impact on operations in the Arctic; novel power sources for unmanned vehicles; interface of law enforcement and military operations; commercial product vulnerabilities and applications; biometrics and forensics science and technology; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination; cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; counter-proliferation initiatives; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.   \n\nThe typical length of an RRTO project falls within a six to 18 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter."

Using a variety of methodologies and disciplinary approaches, the research teams for this project built a qualitative and quantitative framework for understanding the drivers of conflict and convergence in the Asia-Pacific region.  Project teams used content analysis, historical comparison, expert elicitation, and quantitative modeling to identify key variables that influence conflict and cooperation, with particular attention to the U.S.-China relationship in context with other key actors.  These analyses informed the development of a systems dynamic model and decision support tool.  The overall objective of the suite of projects contained in this effort was to inform U.S. Pacific Command decision makers in the development of intermediate and long-term strategies to manage risk and engage opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.  In addition to the insights provided by each project team, the projects also informed a systems dynamic model and decision support tool for COCOMs.  These assessments are intended to be combined with unclassified (e.g., academic, subject matter expert, etc.) input not generally found in U.S. government work."

Using a variety of methodologies and disciplinary approaches, the research teams for this project built a qualitative and quantitative framework for understanding the drivers of conflict and convergence in the Asia-Pacific region.  Project teams used content analysis, historical comparison, expert elicitation, and quantitative modeling to identify key variables that influence conflict and cooperation.  These analyses informed the development of a systems dynamic model and decision support tool.  The overall objective of the suite of projects contained in this effort was to inform USPACOM decision makers in the development of intermediate and long-term strategies to manage risk and engage opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.  In addition to the insights provided by each project team, the projects also informed a systems dynamic model and decision support tool for COCOMs.  These assessments are intended to be combined with unclassified (e.g., academic, subject matter expert, open source, etc.) input not generally found in U.S. government work."
