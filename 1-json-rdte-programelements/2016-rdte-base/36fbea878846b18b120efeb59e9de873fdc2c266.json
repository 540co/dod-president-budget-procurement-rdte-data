This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nThis PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."
