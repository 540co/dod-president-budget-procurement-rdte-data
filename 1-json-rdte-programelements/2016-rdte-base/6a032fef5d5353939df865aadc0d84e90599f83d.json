            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on high energy lasers, Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) development, Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP), high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic\/infrared (EO\/IR) sensor technologies. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The first element involves applied research and development of technologies supporting advanced accelerators with applications to directed energy weapons. This activity also includes the Free Electron Laser (FEL) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) which will deliver multi-mission capability. \n \nFY 2014 to FY 2015 increases in funding are due to increased work on the Solid State Laser (SSL) program. The SSL-QRC program was initiated during FY 2013 and is planned to complete during FY 2015 with plans to demonstrate the system at sea in CY 2014.\n\nFY 2015 to FY 2016 decrease in funding is due to completion of the Solid State Laser - QRC program as well as a continued realignment of FEL activities."

Consider analysis of smaller FEL system designs.\n\nSolid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM): \n-Continued the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and\/or defeat.  This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence.\n-Conduct lethality testing for notional solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions.  \n-Continued and conducted studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces.\n-Continued and conducted trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered \"break through\" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system.\n-Continued and conducted scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters.\n-Continued and conducted scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent \"safe-arm\" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self- defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)"

Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and\/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and\/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. \n\nThe metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational\/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments\/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational\/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass\/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development\/demonstration program."
