There are two major activities under the Modeling and Simulation project: Modeling and Simulation and DODIN Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE).\n\nThe DODIN EWSE activity resolves near term (one to three years) high-priority technical issues defined by Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), that impact operational capabilities affecting DODIN End-to-End (E2E) interoperability and performance. \n\nThe Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and E2E analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DoD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, the DISA Enterprise Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance, the Defense Information Systems Network Command Center and Joint Communications Simulation System users in DoD.\n\nThe DODIN Systems Engineering and Support project defines and validates that the overall technical strategies for DISA are aligned with key DoD Strategic Planning and Execution documents. These documents include the DoD IT Efficiency strategy, DoD CIO\u2019s Campaign Plan, Joint Information Environment (JIE) Roadmap and Concept of Operations, DoD Instructions and Memorandum, other critical high-level guidance documents and target architectures and transition plans. These strategies establish the foundation for technology investments, technical developments, and the operations and sustainment of critical net-centric products and services provided by DISA. The DISA Chief Technology Officer (CTO) conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight.  CTO's early identification of technology needs in coordination with DARPA and will be managed through the DISA Technology Information Repository (DTIR).  CTO conducts system engineering oversight, as well as critical technology evaluations and technical maturity assessments."

Will analyze\/prototype cloud computing services that can be integrated or interoperated with DoD capabilities. Will examine application of Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies for Core Data Centers and DISN. The results will be socialized with the DoD community for action\/adoption or further development. Where appropriate, the results will also be documented in GIG Technical Profiles (GTP) for compliance by the Programs of Record (POR).\n\nWill continue efforts to enhance modeling capabilities that will provide DISN IP and Transport Capacity Planning models, modifying tools and processes to reflect the operational DISN architecture and technologies as evolved under Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiatives and technical advances. These enhancements include: (1) preparing for the FY 2016 Technology Refresh (feasibility analyses required prior to hardware being added to the DODIN) and new user requirements; (2) enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for new or evolving enterprise Services and customer needs in DISA program\/project decisions and planning (e.g. JIE and Defense Enterprise Computing  enters); (3) DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives for the DISA Director, CYBERCOM, GIG Operations, Mission Assurance, and Network Services; (4) enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning and performance assessments in support of Unified Communications and E2E security goals of the evolving DISN; and (5) an updated version of the Joint Communications Simulation System.\n\nThe decrease of -$0.312 between FY 2015 and FY 2016 is attributable to reduction in research efforts for Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering; specifically the Service Level Interoperability for Tactical Edge and Core (SLITEC) area."

Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD\/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). FFRDCs are also considered depending upon the task."

DISA CTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight. CTO\u2019s early identification of technology needs will be managed through the Technology Management Framework (TMF), a part of the broader Advanced Technology Identification and Insertion Process (ATIIP). TMF uses as its substrate an institutionalized, directorate partnering construct (i.e. DISA CIO, CTO, Strategic Planning and Information (SPI)), based upon an Enterprise Architecture (EA) methodology. \n\nThe CTO supports end to end (E2E) technology evaluations, assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of potential technology solutions, products, capabilities and services to ensure consistency with DoD Information Network (DODIN) architecture and standards.  Our products provide actionable, decision-oriented information to the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other mission partners in satisfying DoD mission objectives.\n\nThe CTO maintains the Technology Environment, which provides the infrastructure, tools, processes, and techniques to perform various types of assessments and evaluations. These include informal quick looks, technology demonstrations, proof-of-concept events, and technology piloting events, as well as formally orchestrated operational assessments.  The Technology Environment is capable of supporting a broad range of topics and issues such as EA, wireless and mobile computing, transport technologies, net-centricity compliance, unified capabilities services, Web 2.0, cloud computing, and social networking."

This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including minority\/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor\/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts."

Metrics that will be used include number and percentage of emerging and mature technologies adopted by DISA and DoD, number and percent of technology research and development initiatives and investments in the DoD, peering organizations and industry partners attributable to technology research. These investments and evolution plans identify, promote, channel and align technology research and investments to reduce time to field emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. See specific metrics below:\n\n1.  Metric:  Performance is measured by the number of technologies assessed and the adoption or influence of the technologies assessed on DoD, DISA or IC programs, projects or services.  Technologies are identified by many venues to include research and development initiatives, technology watch-lists from various sources (e.g. in-house, peer organizations, industry and\/or academic advisors) and commercial product releases that have potential applicability to the warfigher mission area.  These measures will allow CTO to align technology research and development with capabilities gaps and needs resulting in improved operational effectiveness and efficiencies.\n\n      Measure\/Goal:  Number of pilot and technology assessments instantiated within the CTO Technical Environment.  Number research initiatives designed, developed and demonstrated and transitioned to programs, projects, or services.  \n\n      FY14 Actual:  8 Assessed and 5 transitioned  \n      FY15 Target:  8 Assessed and 5 transitioned  \n      FY16 Target:  8 Assessed and 5 transitioned"
