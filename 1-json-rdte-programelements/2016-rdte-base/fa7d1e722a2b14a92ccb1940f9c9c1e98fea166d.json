It will mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability across the Spectrum of Conflict. The AMPV will replace five mission roles currently performed by the M113 FoV by transferring the current M113 Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) to a new Military Vehicle Derivative (MVD) platform. In total, the AMPV FOV will account for approximately 30% of the ABCT\u2019s tracked fleet and consists of the following five variants:\n\n1.  Mission Command (MCmd) Vehicle: This platform enables effective mission command planning and execution for both the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and Tactical Command Vehicle (TAC) versions of the MCmd. It will host current Battle Command Systems, future replacements, and upgrades of hardware and software.\n2.  Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.\n3.  Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litter or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.\n4.  General Purpose (GP) Vehicle: This platform will operate throughout the battle space by conducting re-supply, maintenance, casualty evacuation, and other tasks within the formation.\n5.  Mortar Carrier (MC) Vehicle: This platform will provide immediate responsive fire support to conduct fast-paced offensive operations.\n\nThe AMPV program has been initiated on the basis of a Capabilities Development Document (CDD) that was approved 21 June 2013. The CDD reflects a set of stable, technologically achievable requirements. A Milestone B (MS B) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) was held 9 December 2014 and it was followed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) that was signed on 22 December 2014. The ADM approved MS B for the AMPV program and entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. In addition, the ADM authorized the Army to proceed with award of the EMD prime contract, which occurred 23 December 2014 to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. (BAE). The FY2014 Accomplishments described below largely reflect the lead-up to the MS B and award of the EMD contract. Included are efforts that are related to the preparation of MS B documents and efforts that are related to evaluation of EMD prime contract proposals. The FY2015 and FY2016 Planned Program are related to contractor efforts specific to the EMD prime contract and to Government efforts that provide oversight of the program and of the contract."

It is expected that the AMPV EMD prime contractor will award key subsystem and component level provider contracts early 2QFY2015. A formal start-of-work meeting will take place 2QFY2015 and work will commence on vehicle design. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is planned for 3QFY2015.

The contractor will support team meetings and reviews and will report program progress through the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Technical Performance Measures (TPMs).  Activities will transition to detailed design of components and subsystems in FY2016 based on the PDR.  These detailed design efforts will be focused on integration of existing components into the AMPV chassis, which will be tailored to the five mission roles. Final prototype designs and related drawings will be completed early in FY2016.  In addition, as nearly all of the subsystems that will be integrated into the prototype structures will be existing designs, most of the hardware at a component level is expected to be ordered in 1QFY2016.  Integration of these components into subsystems will commence 2QFY2016 and will be mostly complete by 4QFY2016.  Prototype final integration, assembly, and checkout will be conducted to allow full vehicle prototypes to begin to be delivered late 1QFY2017.  In addition to prototype development and fabrication, the engineering work will conclude with the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 3QFY2016.  All artifacts that support CDR will be developed and delivered to the government 60 days prior to the review. Approximately 50 artifacts are expected to be delivered in support of CDR. Government Furnished Material for the system prototypes, mainly consisting of Mission Equipment Packages and communication hardware, will be procured by 2QFY2016.  Final builds for armor coupons and ballistic hull test articles will be completed to support live fire\/survivability testing in FY17."
