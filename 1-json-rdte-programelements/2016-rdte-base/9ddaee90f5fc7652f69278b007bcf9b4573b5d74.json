The SLRS provides the capability to track and destroy an errant rocket in flight to protect the public, which enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely. SLRS is also a test range, supporting intercontinental and sea-launched ballistic missile test launches, national missile defense tests, and aeronautical tests.\n\nSLRS is comprised of twelve subsystems (2000 assets) that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data to the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO), who is certified to determine if a rocket in flight is on course. The Weather and Surveillance subsystems provide the MFCO information about the surroundings to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing & Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics, etc.) to the MFCO. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation. Because aging range systems are exhibiting decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning.\n\nBA 7 - This program activity is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fudning in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThe FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.164 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances."
