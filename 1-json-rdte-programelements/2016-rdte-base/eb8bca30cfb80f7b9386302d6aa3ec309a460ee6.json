This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  \n\nThis PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge Program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.

It is centered on Naval S&T efforts supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Outreach includes the encouragement, promotion, planning, coordination and administration of Naval Science and Technology. \n\nFunding also supports ONRG International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Research Enterprise to effectively address current needs of the Fleet\/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities. This is accomplished through PHD-level Associate Director scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America collaborating with international organizations and researchers through grants in innovative basic research, and establishing quality, relevant connections between international science and technology (S&T) centers of excellence and DON, DOD, and other US Government organizations. The direct impact of this investment is to capitalize on international basic research during unprecedented and dynamic global interdependence, increasing the ability to solve DON S&T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners during a time of budget constraints. Additionally, this investment builds global S&T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners to enhance global security.\n\nThe funding increase in FY 2015 and 2016 is the result of significant emphasis in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiative."

In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance. The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement. \n\nIn FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention.\n\nFunding decrease in FY 2015 is due to normalization of annual investment following initial emphasis in program research."

It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia\/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."
