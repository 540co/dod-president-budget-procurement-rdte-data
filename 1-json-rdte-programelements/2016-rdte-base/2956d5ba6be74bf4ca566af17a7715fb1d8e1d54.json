Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated address blast, fragmentation, penetration, low-collateral damage, variable depth\/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."
