MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network, and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level.  It's route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one coherent network.

This approach takes advantage of competitively priced, mature and producible technology that meets technical specifications.\n \nAn ADM was signed on 20 September 2013 by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), approving a Materiel Development Decision (MDD). The ADM designated MNVR as an ACAT 1D Special Interest Program under the continued oversight of the DAE.  The ADM also approved the award of an Industry contract, and authorized the purchase of  up to 232 modified NDI radios for Test & Evaluation, Platform Integration and Certification purposes in order to inform a MS C decision.\n\nIn 4QFY 2015, the MNVR program will provide all regulatory and statutory documentation in preparation for the Milestone C (MS C) decision, which will allow the program to move forward into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  PdM MNVR will support IOT&E in order to complete all testing and certifications, and support platform integration, meeting the lead time required for production of platform integration assets.\n\nIn 4QFY 2016, after Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) is successfully completed, the program will move forward to the Full Rate Production decision to garner approval to field.   Delivery Order 3 will then procure radio systems in support of fielding to CS 17-18."
