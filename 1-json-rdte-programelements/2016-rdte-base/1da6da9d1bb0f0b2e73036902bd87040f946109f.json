The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&E investments and provide assessment to meeting:\n1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&E\nsuccesses across the Department:\n\nPerformance metrics are measured through an increase of MILDEC capability and capacity as demonstrated by the following:\n- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address Combatant Command and\/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. \n- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.\n- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DOD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application."
