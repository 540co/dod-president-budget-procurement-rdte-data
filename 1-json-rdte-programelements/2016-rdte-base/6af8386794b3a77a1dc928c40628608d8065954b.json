A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts.
