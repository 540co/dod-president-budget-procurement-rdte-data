Bio-warfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect evolution of natural and engineered emerging pathogen threats, and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies include a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze large amounts of data and provide tools to make better-informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics. FY 2015 Biomedical Technology program funding includes 114.8 million of base funding and 45.0 million of Ebola emergency funding."

A key component of this program is not only identifying effective antibodies to treat and prevent disease, but also defining and developing the antibody gene blueprint for transfer and production of vaccines. The Ebola Response and Preparedness Congressional Add is non-OCO emergency funding. \n\n-  Conduct dose escalation study for encoded Ebola vaccine. \n-  Demonstrate rapid discovery of potent antibodies from human Ebola survivors.  \n-  Evaluate protective efficacy of encoded Ebola antibodies in small and\/or large animal models.  \n-  Test protective efficacy of encoded Ebola vaccine in small and\/or large animal models.\n-  Validate cell-free production of nucleic acid-encoded antibody or vaccine formulations."

Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.

The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.\n\nApplied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy."

The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.  Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power\/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution\/energy storage.  The final system is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform missions with reduced risk of injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance, and the long-term health of our veterans."

One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression."

The emergence of advanced medical imaging includes newly recognized physical properties of biological tissue, metabolic pathways, or physiological function in order to produce an image of diagnostic utility and performance.  The goal of this thrust was to develop new, portable spectroscopic techniques that can provide information for military medical use (e.g., analysis of traumatic brain injury) that is superior to that provided by an MRI.  This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional, and cellular-level interactions.  Finally, this thrust allowed safe, non-invasive to minimally invasive detection of microscopic and functional alterations within tissues and organs of a living organism at early stages of injury.  The advanced development of these tools has provided a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care."

This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements were achieved by an aggressive, milestone-driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology, and training.  The results of this program radically improved the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function."
