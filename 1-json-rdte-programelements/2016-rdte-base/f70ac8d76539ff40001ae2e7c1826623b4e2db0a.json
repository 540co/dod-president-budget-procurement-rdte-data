This program is part of an overall DoD HEL Science and Technology (S&T) program.  HEL weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage.  Efforts funded under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple HEL systems and multiple Service missions while complimenting Service\/Agency programs that are directed at specific Service needs.  A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as laser sources, laser beam control, modeling and simulation, and laser lethality mechanisms.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the DoD S&T Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."
