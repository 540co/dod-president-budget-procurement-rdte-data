The environment will utilize the services provided by the CCE.   \n\nCCE develops a standard framework, platform configurations, data center migration strategy and security services for hosting AF mission applications.  This initiative is critical for the target hosting environment effort leveraging DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This initiative also includes an Air Force Managed Service Office (MSO) which provides AF approved application rationalization processes to the target hosting environment architecture and an enterprise IT lifecycle capability for integration test of CCE services.  Effort previously documented in GCSS-AF program element 0303141F\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
