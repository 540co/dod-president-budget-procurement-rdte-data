            "val": "Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets.  A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.  \n\nJLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.\n\nJLENS will participate in the NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region IADS Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14- FY17.  The OPEX will include an operational assessment to \"inform a future decision for enduring operational employment\", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13.  The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX is to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) \/ Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters\/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)\/GBAD via TDL.\n\nThe JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of a JLENS Orbit at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013."

                            "val": "JLENS has been directed to support the Homeland Defense Operational Exercise in the National Capital Region from FY 2014 to FY 2017 and will be assessed during the exercise to support a follow on decision from Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  The JLENS Product Office has a requirement for the acquisition of services through the JLENS Exercise Contract to support the deployment of JLENS Orbit deployed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), MD as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.\n\nExercise preparation was conducted in FY 2013 on a limited basis to facilitate 2014 Activities as funding became available. Site development was projected to be completed 2014 with MILCON funding, followed by emplacement of the Orbit on the developed tactical sites at APG in 1Q 2015. Due to new start constraints related to the Continuing Resolution Act (CRA), MILCON funding was not received in time to complete construction in 2014 as planned.The sites are being constructed sequentially with the Surveillance Radar System (SuS) being the first to be completed.  Current projection for both sites to be completed is June 2015.  To allow operations to commence as early as possible, the MILCON contractor agreed to co-occupancy of the SuS site to allow JLENS System Integration and Check-out concurrent with completion of MILCON activities.\n\nTransfer of operational control for operations to the Combatant Command is expected to be in 2QFY15 with end of the exercise at the end of 3QFY2017.  The Orbit will be disassembled and placed in storage at the conclusion of the Exercise unless directed otherwise.  The COCOM Exercise Contract is to support the JLENS NCR Exercise at APG, MD.  December 5, 2014 the contract was awarded as an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) for the 6 month base period of the contract.  The contract is scheduled to be definitized and Option 1 awarded by May 2015.  This contract is planned to have 3 option periods beginning every June until the contract ends in September 2017.\n\nThe JLENS system is sustained by a two-Level maintenance concept consisting of Field and Sustainment Levels.  Sustainment level maintenance for common support equipment is supported by standard Army procedures and all sustainment level maintenance for JLENS peculiar or unique equipment is provided by the Prime Contractor.  Prime Contractor will serve as the supply chain manager and ensure failed spares are requisitioned and replaced to ensure system is operational.  There is no organic capability for the JLENS peculiar equipment at this time.  The JLENS Product Office retains major end item management responsibilities and performs oversight of the contractor's efforts.\n\nA recommendation for continuing JLENS operations as an enduring mission will be considered by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) based on results of the Combatant Commander's assessment of the initial operations period in support of the NCR Exercise.   Upon receipt of direction to proceed with Enduring Mission or to store or dispose of the system, the Department of Defense will address funding needs to meet the requirements of the decision.  Based on the system being an EMD versus Production unit, an enduring mission decision will require major technical refresh of the system due to obsolescence and wear and tear. A competitive or sole source contract will be pursued if the decision is for an enduring mission.  The current budget provides funding through FY 2017 for the JLENS Homeland Defense Operational Exercise and FY 2018 for program close-out.  Depending on the results of the enduring mission decision, POM submissions will be required for continued operations, to include technical refresh, for transportation to storage and cost of storage, or for transportation to appropriate location for demilitarization along with the cost of demilitarization. \n\nThe EMD contract was completed 31 December 2013 and close-out tasks were initiated.  The SDD JLENS Systems, sub-systems, components, etc. were transferred to the Government on 19 December 2013 via DD250s.  A modification to the current Engineering Services contract was awarded on 20 December 2013, incorporating all Government Furnished Property (GFP).  The current Engineering Services Contract will continue through September 30th, 2015, for technical refresh assessments; conducting analysis required in support of the Homeland Defense Exercise; training of soldiers; maintaining equipment until ready for shipment to the exercise location; packaging, handling and transportation of equipment to the exercise location; and system set-up, integration and check-out.   The JLENS Product Office anticipates that a new technical requirements contract will be awarded in the first quarter of 2016 for contractor technical requirements support during the Exercise."
