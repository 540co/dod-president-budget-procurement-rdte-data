            "val": "Projects 090\/DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.\n\nProject 093. MLRS is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, Precision Strike weapon system that is organic\/assigned to Fires Brigades supporting BCT.  The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  The launcher is complimented by the MFOM to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), engaging targets up to 60 kilometers (km).  AFOM munitions are capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 km.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament and system hardware and software technologies, including COE and NIE, obsolesence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format. \n\nProjects 784\/78G.  Beginning in FY2015, GMLRS will have its own separate Program Element, 0205778A, to include Projects EG2 (GMLRS Alternative Warhead) and EG3 (Guided MLRS), previously under Program Element 0603778A Project Codes 78G and 784, respectively.  GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the MLRS and HIMARS launchers.  GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  \n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) is being developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production.  GMLRS AW is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and scheduled to enter full rate production in FY2015.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.\n\nProject DZ8. The Army G-3\/5\/7 has directed that GMLRS Increment 4 change its name to Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to better reflect the solution as an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) replacement versus a follow-on increment to the GMLRS program.  LRPF is being developed as a non-cluster munition to provide Joint Force Command with a 24\/7 all weather long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk."

Development efforts underway include Enhanced C2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government.   Seven prototype cabs have been delivered with integration of cab to launcher ongoing; testing will be completed in FY15.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current and future capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The FCS-U development effort began in FY13, utilizing the industrial Engineering Services contract that was previously sole source awarded.  Contract efforts include finalizing design, testing, and qualification of the FCS-U with scheduled completion in FY16.  Government activities to close out government efforts to continue in FY16. PDR has been conducted and CDR was completed in  1Q FY15 with prototype delivery to begin in 2QFY15."

GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.\n\nThe GMLRS AW increment completed Milestone B (MS B) on February 19, 2012 and is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.  The three-year EMD contract was awarded on March 30, 2012.  Funding was requested in FY2013 for the second year of the EMD contract and for other government and contracted EMD activities to include engineering developmental testing and the Critical Design Review (CDR).  GMLRS AW is scheduled for a combined Milestone C (MS C) and Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision in FY2015 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY2016."

The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and is still supporting Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both U.S. Army and Marine Corps units."

The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counterfire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Missile Launch Pod Container (MLPC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  The Army is conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), based on an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) approved Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.  The AoA is scheduled for completion in March 2015.\n\nThe Army is funding the development of the LRPF under Program Element 0603778A project code DZ8.   The LRPF program currently has a Milestone (MS) A Decision scheduled for 1QFY16.  Funding is requested in FY2016 to conduct competitive sub-system risk reduction activities under DoD Section 845 Other Transaction Authority (OTA), to mature the rocket motor and warhead technology to support the award of Technology Maturation\/Risk Reduction (TM\/RR) system demonstration contracts in FY17.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TM\/RR Phase.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2019 and MS C in FY2022."

The Acquisition Strategy is for competitive prototyping for TM\/RR at both the sub-system and system demonstration levels.  After a MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will initiate TM\/RR activities with awards in 3QFY16 for critical sub-system prototyping under the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Section 845 (NDAA 1994) Other Transaction Authority. The program will also conduct a full and open competition in FY2016 of a 24-month TM\/RR competitive prototyping and flight demonstration phase to be awarded to two contractors in 2QFY2017.  Flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY18 will lead to a limited competition for the EMD contract and competitive down select at MS B."
