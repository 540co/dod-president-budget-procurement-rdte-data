            "val": "This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.\n\nThe major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced materials, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and\/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, energetic materials and devices, low distortion optical lenses, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles.\n\nThe Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new DoD capabilities.  This influence extends throughout the development of new materials, devices, and processes and relies on the integration of biological breakthroughs with those in engineering and the physical sciences.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, the application of materials in biological applications, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for materials synthesis.  This project also includes major efforts aimed at integrating biological and digital sensing methodologies and maintaining human combat performance despite the extraordinary stressors of combat.  Finally, this thrust will develop new cognitive therapeutics, investigate the role of complexity in biological systems, and explore neuroscience technologies."

It will also develop approaches that yield new materials and materials capabilities that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques (3D printing, manufacture on demand, etc.) and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Further research within this thrust, will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design.  This process will complete underspecified designs when possible and initiate an iterative dialog with a human to specify details as needed and actively suggest changes to designers when the intended design cannot operate within the required specifications."

One goal of this research is the ability to design, develop and demonstrate materials with combinations of properties that are normally orthogonal (e.g. damage tolerance and biocompatibility).  This capability will ultimately lead to enhanced lethality, survivability and performance in future DoD platforms.  This thrust will also include the exploration and development of dynamic models of complex systems across scale and develop new methodologies for understanding, architecting and engineering complex systems.  These computational tools will link material properties to physics across multiple length scales (from molecule to part) and provide the ability to model and exploit complexity, such as hierarchy and strongly correlated effects, in structural and functional materials.  Development efforts under this thrust include reactive structures that can serve as both structure and explosive for lightweight munitions, novel materials and surfaces that are designed to adapt structural or functional properties to environmental and\/or tactical threat conditions, and new thin film material deposition processes to improve the performance of surface dominated properties (friction, wear, and membrane permeability).  In addition, this thrust will also explore new cost effective processes for ensuring DoD accessibility to future advanced materials.  Examples of DoD applications that will benefit from these material developments include lower weight and higher performance aircraft, turbines with enhanced efficiency, erosion-resistant rotor blades, and high-temperature materials for operation in hypersonic environments."

The program will expand the application of gradient index optics (GRIN) by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical systems with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units."

The HyDem program designed, manufactured, and supplied the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class Submarine.  The Navy is evaluating this component in sea trials.  If successful, it is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement Submarines, and possibly back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class Submarines.

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms), leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to enable new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices, and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nResearch thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bioproduction pipelines, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems for novel materials.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Integrated processes developed in this program will translate into significant performance improvements and cost savings for the production of advanced materials, biological reporting systems, and therapeutics.  These technologies will ultimately result in on-demand, customizable, and distributed production of strategic materials and systems.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules and chemical building blocks with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments)."

One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to map the bioelectric code that controls the immune response as well as other critical organ functions.  This program will also develop capabilities for serial measurements of metabolic state to identify correlates for health and early detection of disease.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, and translating this response into a quantitative framework that can be used to guide modulation of the immune response.  Algorithms will be developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions within an individual and could later be expanded to track the health of various communities.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve our response capability against severe infectious diseases and biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease with no available drugs, such as multiple drug resistant organisms.  The ultimate goals for the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program are to enable an autonomous and continuous sense and response capability to regulate the human immune response and to develop decision support tools that help manage general health such as tracking and combatting infectious diseases in a community.  It is anticipated that these capabilities will ultimately provide enhanced protection against injury, enable life-saving rescue from hyper-immune activity, and stimulate advances in regenerative medicine."

These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will create modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore physical and cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using physiological and neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.
