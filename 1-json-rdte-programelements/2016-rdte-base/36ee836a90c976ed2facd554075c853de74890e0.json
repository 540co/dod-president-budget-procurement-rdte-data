            "val": "The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect Joint Service research and development (R&D) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Executive Agent. Research conducted is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Document. This coordinated joint R&D development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative Service investment. Advanced Component Development and Prototypes provide non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.\n\nThis PE funds Joint Service research, development, test, and evaluation of non-lethal weapon (NLW) systems and technologies that provide a non-lethal capability to minimize fatal or permanent injuries as well as undesired damage to property and the environment. NLWs are defined as weapons, devices, and munitions that are explicitly designed and primarily employed to incapacitate targeted personnel or materiel immediately, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property in the target area or environment. NLW are intended to have reversible effects on personnel and materiel. (DoDD 3000.03E, DoD Executive Agent for Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW), and NLW Policy)\n\nThe Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate is designated as a R&D organization and was established by the Executive Agent to manage the day to day research and development activities of the DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program. The JNLWP funding resources the USA, USAF, USN, USMC, SOCOM, and USCG in support of NLW research and development efforts. Each Service is responsible for their procurement and operating support costs."
