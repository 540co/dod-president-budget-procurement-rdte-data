            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is to safeguard the United States and its allies from global weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities.  This mission directly aligns with several National and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents. For Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, these documents include the National Security Strategy, Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense), Quadrennial Defense Review, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Defense Planning Guidance, Guidance for Employment of the Force, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission, DTRA established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. \n\nThis program element supports the development of system capabilities for the countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) mission.  This funding specifically supports technologies to meet International Monitoring System technology requirements in support of nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology program. Through FY 2014, funding also supported the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between the DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset."

DTRA\u2019s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS).  This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.  \n  \nThe project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams. \n \nThe primary RDT&E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests.  The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is for an enhanced level of investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities."

Continued infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction and noise mitigation analyses.  \n- Drove improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection\/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  Technical requirements continue to dictate that the U.S. radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  \n- Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories."

The project addresses weapons of mass destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, and provide the data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy and decision-makers, and negotiation teams.  NOTE:  As this program and its requirements mature and legacy contract vehicles expire, the composition of the performer base under DTRA program management will be dynamic."

It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, National, state, and local authorities.  \n\nThe decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments."
