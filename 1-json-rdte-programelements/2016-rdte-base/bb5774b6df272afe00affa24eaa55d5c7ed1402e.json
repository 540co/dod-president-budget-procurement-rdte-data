            "val": "The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department\u2019s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cTesting in a Joint Environment Roadmap\u201d to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to \u201ctest like we fight.\u201d  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability; supporting system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service\/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. By linking distributed facilities, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, the Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR).  TRMC undertook management oversight of the NCR, including all operational activities and sustainment of resources, transitioning it from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Science & Technology project to an operational capability supporting cyber test, experimentation, and training events. The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration\/federation of cyberspace T&E infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  In FY-14 the NCR demonstrated robust operational capability supporting 20 different events for a diverse set of customers including US Cyber Command, Joint Staff J-7, Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) and US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The NCR was critical to the successful execution of CyberFlag 14-1, CyberGuard 14-1, 14-2 and 14-3 and just completed CyberFlag 15-1 in the 1QFY15. In 3QFY14 the NCR team executed the first Cybersecurity Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) event supporting a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), the MQ-4C Triton Program. In the 1QFY-15 the NCR executed a second MDAP Cybersecurity DT&E Event in support of the P-8A Increment Three. In FY-15, a Systems of Systems Cybersecurity DT&E Event will be conducted involving triton, the P-8A and Tactical Mobile (TACMobile) Program. Additional events are planned in support of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), F-35 (Re-programming Center West) Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission Space (JMS) Program and other acquisition and operational customers. Concurrent with these NCR Events are engineering activities to sustain and upgrade NCR Computing Resources, improve the automated software tool suite and improve operational capabilities to satisfy increasing customer demand.      \n\nThe Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department\u2019s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and operations."

JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC\u2019s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to 77 sites, 12 peering points to other networks, and an additional 12 planned sites.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  In the past year, JMETC has used this expertise and infrastructure to support over 65 customer events.\nAdditionally in FY 2013, the JMETC PE was funded to develop and build the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP).  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable."

The NCR was funded in FY 2013 through funds provided by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research & Engineering)(ASD(R&E)) reprogramming, and the TRMC investment programs.  In FY 2014, the NCR was funded from the JMETC Program Element.  The NCR provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration\/federation of cyberspace test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  It supports a diverse user base and accommodates a wide variety of event types (R&D, Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E), Security Control Assessor (SCA)  Compliance, Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics\/Malware Analysis) and communities (research, systems engineering, testing, operations, training, etc.).  The NCR has the capability to support up to 4 concurrent events at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture.  It is accredited to operate at TS\/\/SI-G\/TK\/HCS-P\/\/SAR.  In support of a variety of customers, the NCR has emulated complex (Red\/Blue\/Gray) operationally representative network environments at a scale up to ~50K high-fidelity virtual nodes.  The NCR can operate in conjunction with other ranges through remote connectivity via JMETC connectivity infrastructure.  The NCR\u2019s Test Automation Tools minimize human error, enable verification of test environment, ensure repeatable results and can reduce event timelines from weeks\/months to hours\/days.  Range assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks\/malware to restore exposed systems to a known, clean state.\n\nThe JMETC-funded National Cyber Range allows acquisition programs and operational forces to efficiently evaluate their cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner."
