This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems. \n\nThe infrastructure and provided Air Force enterprise common services are a critical basis for the target common computing environment (CCE) effort which Air Force Guidance Memorandum has directed for all new and modernizing IT applications.  This effort is the Air Force evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This framework is a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  It is comprised of development tools, an initial set of enterprise services, and governance processes critical to JIE management.   \n\nThis system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs. In this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows.  \n\nActivities also include capability development of an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems. \n\nThe infrastructure and provided Air Force enterprise common services are a critical basis for the target common computing environment (CCE) effort which Air Force Guidance Memorandum has directed for all new and modernizing IT applications.  This effort is the Air Force evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This framework is a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  It is comprised of development tools, an initial set of enterprise services, and governance processes critical to JIE management.   \n\nThis system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs. In this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows.  \n\nActivities also include Enterprise Protection Risk Management (EPRM), a capability development of an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
