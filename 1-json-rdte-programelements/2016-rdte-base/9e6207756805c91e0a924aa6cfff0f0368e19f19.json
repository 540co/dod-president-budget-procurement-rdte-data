            "val": "The Terminal Defense Program Element includes the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) development program, Cyber Operations, THAAD System Test, support of PATRIOT (Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept Of Target) Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) participation in Missile Defense Agency (MDA) activities, and Program Wide Support (PWS). \n\nTHAAD provides the only air transportable, fast reaction capability for the warfighter to provide area coverage against Short and Medium Range Ballistic Missiles within four hours of arrival. The THAAD element includes five major components:  Interceptors, Launchers, Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance - Type 2 (AN\/TPY-2) Radars, THAAD Fire Control and Communication (TFCC), and THAAD Peculiar Support Equipment. THAAD delivered Battery #1 in FY 2009 and Battery #2 in FY 2010 to the U.S. Army at Fort Bliss, Texas for initial fielding and training. THAAD has completed the development of the THAAD 1.0 configuration and is developing the THAAD Build 2.0 capability. Continued development and integration will provide for enhanced debris mitigation, improved interoperability with other Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) elements, and development of training devices to support the THAAD Institutional Training Base.  In FY 2016, THAAD Follow-On (extended range, integrated battle command system, and threat upgrades) will begin with a risk reduction effort with the potential to transition to a new start follow-on THAAD program in the future.  The technical merits of expanded system interoperability with air and missile defense systems, and expanding the battlespace and defended area of the THAAD baseline weapon system will be evaluated during risk reduction activities to explore and mature the design concept and to validate the threat assessment.  The decision to transition to a new follow-on THAAD program will be determined by evaluating the results of the technical merits and the program's affordability upon development of the program life cycle cost estimate.\n \nCyber Operations sustain Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities, analysis of validation results, risk assessments and reviews of proposed Program Manager\/Information Assurance Manager (PM\/IAM) Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for MDA Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) mission systems and supports THAAD certification to operate in the BMD System. Cyber Operations include non-recurring requirements in FY 2015 to FY 2017 to transition all THAAD information systems from DIACAP to DoD directed Risk Management Framework.\n\nTHAAD System Test conducts BMDS Flight Tests and Ground Tests with other BMDS elements (including BMDS C2BMC, PATRIOT and Aegis) in accordance with BMDS Integrated Master Test Plan. THAAD System Test coordinates with Operational Test Agencies, conducts flight test operations, performs post-flight test reporting, and performs data distribution and data storage at Pacific Missile Range Facility and the Reagan Test Site. \n\nPATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) is a U.S. Army short range BMDS that interfaces with the BMDS. MDA funds PATRIOT participation in BMDS interoperability integration efforts. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

This capability includes engagements against short to medium-range ballistic missiles and asymmetric threats. Development of THAAD's next incremental capability (2.0) will enhance and extend the current 1.0 capability and be delivered as part of THAAD's acquisition\/development strategy.  \n\nTHAAD 1.0 (Baseline Capability Development) provided the fundamental capability against short and medium-range Ballistic Missiles and asymmetric threats inside and outside the atmosphere by FY 2012. This development completed with: 1) Ground and Flight Test of the weapon system against complex Re-entry Vehicles, background clutter, and Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) threats; 2) Ground and Flight Test of the initial Discrimination Capability; 3) Enhanced communication capability to support Link 16 compatibility with the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and engagement coordination with other BMDS elements; and 4) Conditional Materiel Release.\n\nTHAAD 2.0 (Advanced Capability Development) began in January of 2012 as a 7 year development effort consisting of multiple, independent software builds (e.g. Build 2.0, Build 3.0, etc.) to expand the capability of THAAD the 1.0 system with a projected capability delivery in FY 2019.  New THAAD capabilities include:  1) Launch on Link 16 BMD System Based Track providing the ability to initiate an engagement and launch of THAAD interceptors using sensor data provided by BMDS sources outside the THAAD Battery; 2) Improving THAAD Weapons System performance in the presence of a high debris environment; 3) Expanding the defended area footprints by remote operation of THAAD Launchers; 4) Peer-to-peer engagement coordination with Aegis and PATRIOT weapon systems; 5) Software upgrades to maintain capability against evolving threats; 6) Message based regional engagement command functionality to process message content from Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to obtain direction for target engagement; 7) Weapon System Information Assurance mandatory updates; 8) Warfighter requested enhancements; and 9) Upgrades to maintain interface with other BMDS software builds.\n\nIn FY 2016, THAAD Follow-On (extended range, integrated battle command system, and threat upgrades) will begin with a risk reduction effort with the potential to transition to a new start follow-on THAAD program in the future.  The technical merits of expanded system interoperability with air and missile defense systems, and expanding the battlespace and defended area of the THAAD baseline weapon system will be evaluated during risk reduction activities to explore and mature the design concept and to validate the threat assessment.  The decision to transition to a new follow-on THAAD program will be determined by evaluating the results of the technical merits and the program's affordability upon development of the program life cycle cost estimate.        \n\nIn addition to THAAD Development and THAAD Follow-On, there are three planned tasks:  THAAD Program Support, Program Operations, and Project Redwood.\n\nTHAAD Program Support provides support for communications and interoperability efforts to operate on multiple networks and safety and mission assurance efforts in support of the Materiel Release process.\n\nProgram Operations provides strategic planning, program integration, cost estimating, contracting, financial management, internal reviews and audits, earned-value management and program assessments for the THAAD Program Office.\n\nProject Redwood- Details at a Higher Classification is reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119 (a)(1) in the Special Access Program Annual Report to Congress."

It maintains the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) data repository, capturing the DIACAP documentation (artifacts, validation results, and Information Assurance Risk Assessment results, and Designated Approving Authority (DAA) accreditation decisions) and POA&M on all MDA information systems.  This project supports THAAD certification to operate in the BMD System. Cyber Operations includes non-recurring requirements in FY 2015 to FY 2017 to transition all THAAD information systems from DIACAP to DoD directed Risk Management Framework.\n\nThis project supports the monitoring and tracking of Cybersecurity mitigations detailed in Information Technology security POA&Ms.   Activities include preparation of C&A documentation and accreditation recommendations to the MDA Senior Information Assurance Officer (SIAO)\/Certification Authority (CA) and DAA.  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) team actions ensure the availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.  Activities in the Project are necessary to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)."
