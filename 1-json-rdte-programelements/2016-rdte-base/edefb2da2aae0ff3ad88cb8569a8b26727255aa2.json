            "val": "The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the upgraded authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  DoD ABIS is an information technology system that supports identity superiority by providing the critical capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS is the authoritative biometrics enterprise system that provides matching, sharing and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-model biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfigher in making, retain, capture or release decisions.  The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).\n\nThe Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) as the Executive Manager for Army Biometrics acts as the DoD proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services.  DFBA leads in the development and implementation of biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Agencies; delivers capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability and; empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers. These directives are carried out by DFBA's Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). OCS coordinates all science and technology (S&T) efforts and oversees the RDT&E program.\n\nJustification:\nFY16 Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding in the amount of $11.770 million supports integration and testing of upgraded Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Search Core software to replace obsolete technology and extend the service life of the DoD ABIS system baseline.  Funds will also support software upgrades to the Electronic Biometrics Transmission Specification (EBTS 2.0) to comply with current DoD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) EBTS 3.0 Standards.\n\nFY 2016 funding in the amount of $1.467 million will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric T&E activities, including standards conformance and Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) interoperability assessments, supporting DoD acquisition organizations, and providing subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders."
