This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support funds future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Hospitals that participate in both the NMDP Network of treatment centers as well as the NDMS that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services were invited to join the RITN.  As a result of this targeted recruitment, eight additional transplant centers joined; unfortunately two centers were lost to attrition resulting in a total composition of: 47 transplant centers, 6 donor centers, and 7 cord blood banks.\n\nDuring this period, the C. W. Bill Young Marrow Donor Recruitment and Research Program, BMRD, NMRC directly contributed to donor recruitment and transplantation and science and technology developments including over 5,000 transplants coordinated by the NMDP of which over 500 were provided by DoD volunteers through the NMRC \/ Georgetown part of the program.  \n\nThe NMDP added over 700,000 volunteer donors to the national registry, of which over 40,000 were from DoD volunteers from the NMRC \/ Georgetown.  \n\nProbe Testing Progress:\nThe laboratory tested 17,885 new volunteers for HLA-A,-B; 17,885 for HLA-C, and 20,805 for HLA-DRB1. In the first three months the laboratory has typed 18,615 donors for HLA-DQB1 and is currently working on providing HLADPB1 typing for those donors. They are currently working on establishing and validating robust assays for DQB1 and DPB1 because of recent studies suggesting that these loci may impact outcome of transplantation; DQB1 when a mismatched donor is selected and DPB1 when a donor with a T cell epitope mismatch is selected.\n\nSequencing Progress Report:\nThrough this grant they continue to improve the robotics and reagents to test samples flow by typing large numbers of donors at recruitment. The PI and team are currently typing 1000 volunteers of European ancestry for the registry using a one step SBT typing method. They previously sequenced 196 loci from patients and potentially matched family members."
