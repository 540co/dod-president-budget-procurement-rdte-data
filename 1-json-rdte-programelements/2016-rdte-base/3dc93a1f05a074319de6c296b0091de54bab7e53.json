            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. \n\nThe ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet\/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet\/Force (F\/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F\/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Human Computer Interaction\/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.\n\nb) Command Decision Making (CDM): This is a new sub-project that consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM sub-project is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that recognize and are responsive to changing mission and task demands, and adapt to present information appropriately.  This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational needs.  Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex & time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty.\n\nc) Social Network Analysis:  Develop computational models, algorithms and technologies for the analysis of conflict and crisis environments and the development of strategies against novel threats, such as terrorism, information warfare, and deception operations.  Develop computational approaches to handling very large, social and socio-cultural information and datasets. Develop computational social science approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements and the novel approaches to crowd calming and peacebuilding for civil affairs operations and disaster response. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.\n\nThis FY 2014 activity funding moves from Program Element 0602235N: Common Picture Applied Research efforts associated with the Human Factors activity and is being transferring into this PE0602236N: Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research to provide an easily navigable overview of all Human Factors investments in a single location."

Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy\/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort."

This is accomplished through PHD-level Associate Director scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America collaborating with international organizations and researchers through grants in innovative applied research, and establishing quality, relevant connections between international science and technology (S&T) centers of excellence and DON, DOD, and other US Government organizations. The direct impact of this investment is to capitalize on international applied research during unprecedented and dynamic global interdependence, increasing the ability to solve DON S&T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners. Additionally, this investment builds global S&T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners and to enhance global security.\n\nFleet\/Forces Science Advisors: \n\nThe Naval Science Advisor (SA) Program ensures the Naval Fleet\/Forces shape the DON investment in applied research S&T, developing teaming relationships in support and development of technology-based capability options for Naval Fleet\/Forces.

Technology development responds to a variety of requirements, including providing more affordable approaches to training and skill maintenance. Improved training efficiency and cost-effectiveness is achieved by applying operations research, modeling and simulation, and instructional, cognitive, and computer sciences to the development, delivery, evaluation, and execution of training."
